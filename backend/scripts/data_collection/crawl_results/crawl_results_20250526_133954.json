Keep your receipts Expenses for eligible legal services incurred on or after April 1, 2019, may be reimbursed. All applications submitted must include an invoice showing the date, fee and contact information of the licensed lawyer as well as proof of payment. On this page About the program Eligibility criteria Apply After you apply Legal resources Privacy and protection of personal information Contact us About the program The overall objective of the program is to help individuals make informed decisions that address their particular needs, goals and circumstances. In the current first phase of the program, the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC) is providing reimbursements for eligible legal costs incurred by those who have experienced sexual misconduct within a DND/CAF context. Examples of legal costs are for legal information, advice and representation in the military and criminal justice systems. All eligible legal expenses must have been incurred on or after April 1, 2019. The SMSRC continues to develop the ILA program so that it can eventually support individuals who have experienced sexual misconduct within a DND/CAF context. This support can include providing individuals with, or facilitating access to, appropriate resources for legal information, advice and representation. Eligibility criteria Individuals, 18 years and older, who have experienced a sexual misconduct incident(s) that occurred within a DND/CAF context. A parent or guardian of an individual under 18 years old who has experienced sexual misconduct can apply for a reimbursement. We acknowledge that every incident(s) has its particular circumstances. Upon referral, an ILA Program staff will review your application and determine if your situation is eligible for reimbursement. Eligible legal fees Reimbursements will be provided for the following incurred legal expenses: Up to four hours of legal information or legal advice pertaining to an incident(s) of sexual misconduct that has occurred within a DND/CAF context. If additional hours are required, it will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Legal representation must take place in a criminal sexual offence or service offence trial where the lawyer is representing the victim in: proceedings pertaining to the admissibility of evidence concerning prior sexual activity of a victim; proceedings pertaining to the production of a victim’s private records. Legal assistance must be obtained from a lawyer licensed to practice law in a Canadian province or territory. Apply To make an application for reimbursement, you can call the SMSRC via the 24/7 Support Line at 1-844-750-1648 or by email Monday to Friday 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time at DND.SMSRC-CSRIS.MDN@forces.gc.ca . An SMSRC counsellor will refer you to a Response and Support Coordinator (RSC) who can explain what the program offers and how to apply. The RSC can also provide other forms of ongoing support and assistance, as needed. Once the RSC refers you to the ILA Program, staff will assist you in determining if you are eligible and in submitting a reimbursement claim, which will include the following documents: Reimbursement application form, including an attestation that the legal services pertained to sexual misconduct within a DND/CAF context and related to the military or criminal justice systems; Invoice from a lawyer; Proof of payment of legal invoice: please ensure hours and rate per hour are included; and include billing for all hours of legal information/advice, even if your total hours are more than four. Banking information. After you apply Once the ILA program staff member has reviewed your request and received all required documents, they will send your financial information to a trustee to provide reimbursement. An external trustee takes care of processing reimbursements to prevent users of the larger Department of National Defence/Canadian Armed Forces (DND/CAF) financial payment system from accessing recipients’ personal information. You can expect to receive reimbursement within four to eight weeks. Reimbursements can only be provided through a Canadian financial institution.

On this page About the Restorative Engagement Program Class members Defence representatives Restorative practitioners Support services and resources Information sessions Send us your feedback Contact Us About the Restorative Engagement Program The Restorative Engagement (RE) Program was mandated through the Canadian Armed Forces-Department of National Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Final Settlement . Mandate Provide supportive and facilitated restorative opportunities for Canadian Armed Forces and National Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Members to be heard and acknowledged, and for Defence Representatives to learn, understand, plan, act and lead as catalysts for change supporting the Institution to end sexual misconduct. Program development and implementation A dedicated RE Program team within the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC) designed and developed the program in collaboration with: subject matter experts in restorative approaches, trauma, sexual misconduct, military norms, culture and conflict resolution; stakeholders including individuals who experienced sexual misconduct in the Defence workplace. We began by consulting with the community we serve, on what they needed in a restorative engagement program. We officially launched the RE Program in its initial operating capability (IOC) on November 15 , 2021. The program contacted a small group of class members to participate. In January 2022, the first groups of Defence representatives began working in cohorts with restorative practitioners to develop the knowledge and skills needed to engage with class members and translate what they learned into meaningful action for culture change. The program has continued to bring together Defence representatives to meet the CMs needs for engagements and to learn from them, and the activities are expected to continue into 2026. Program team The RE Program team is composed of the following: Director of RE : reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer of the SMSRC Deputy Director: responsible for integrated human resources, business and financial planning, research, program support, evaluation, and strategic support to the RE Director. Managers of Operations (three) : responsible for implementing the program by region (East, Central, West/North) Restorative practitioners : responsible for facilitating participation of Defence representatives and class members in the program. Learn more about their role . Each region has a positional mailbox: East (NL, NB, NS, PEI, QC, French and International): REeast-DRest@forces.gc.ca Central (ON and NCR): REcentral-DRcentrale@forces.gc.ca West/North (BC, YK, MB, SK, AB, NT, NU): REwest-DRouest@forces.gc.ca A restorative approach to justice The RE Program applies a restorative approach to help CAF/DND contribute to culture change. Principles of a restorative approach Focused on relations Puts people and their relationships to one another, between groups and with institutions, at the centre. A restorative approach places the emphasis on addressing harm and establishing or re-establishing justice and trust in relationships. This is done by mutual dignity, respect, care and concern. Comprehensive and holistic Works in integrated ways and looks for the connections between issues, causes, circumstances, and culture. Inclusive and participatory Including and empowering those with lived experience, being open and transparent with them about options and limitations, honouring choices for how they would like to participate, and removing barriers to access. Responsive Being flexible and adaptable in all of our work so as to be responsive to participants’ needs, objectives, and circumstances and the context within which the program exists. Focused on individual and collective responsibility Pays attention to the ways in which the system affects individuals and the ways in which individuals affect the system. Defence representatives take responsibility for change in their daily roles and work with each other and the institution to address structural factors that contribute to harm. Collaborative and non-adversarial Looks at bringing people into the process and working towards a common goal rather than working against one another. Confidentiality The RE Program is confidential.  Participation in, and information shared within the program, are confidential within legal limitations. If you choose to share your experience(s), you may do so anonymously. All personal information is handled in accordance with the Privacy Act . The RE Program is outside the CAF chain of command and the investigation process. Participation in the program is not part of any administrative, disciplinary or criminal process. Class members The RE Program does not facilitate communication between class members and those who directly harmed them. What to expect There are different ways in which class members may share their experiences and insights related to sexual misconduct. As part of RE, class members may choose to share with a Defence representative: as much or as little as they would like about their experience(s) of sexual misconduct, such as: the harm how it was, or was not, responded to the impact it had on their life their thoughts and knowledge about the causes of sexual misconduct and what needs to change to better respond and prevent it. Class members may choose to share either: Individually: with a Defence representative (in-person, virtually, by phone) and may include support person(s) by sharing indirectly with a Defence representative with, or without, requiring a response In a group setting with: class members and Defence representatives (virtually) other class members (virtually) and by sharing indirectly with Defence representatives with, or without, requiring a response Restorative practitioners facilitate communications with class members and help them prepare through individual sessions before engagements with Defence representatives. Class members are in control of the information they provide and what they choose to share. Engagement sessions are also facilitated by restorative practitioners. Phases of the Restorative Engagement process Phase 1 Class members meet with restorative practitioners and learn more about the: program purpose approach limits options for participation Restorative practitioners will also facilitate class members to: determine if the program can meet their objectives make an informed decision about whether or not they want to participate explore what supports they might need during engagements and ensure they are connected with resources for support, if needed Class members can but will not be asked t o share their sexual misconduct experience. Phase 2 In this phase, restorative practitioners will guide class members to: identify their objectives for the engagement process decide what experiences, knowledge and/or insights they want to share and how decide on what engagement option they would like to select and prepare themselves to engage with Defence representative(s). Phase 3 In this phase, class members will be invited to: reflect on and discuss their experience in the program share their feedback and reflect on next steps, and discuss their expectations regarding maintaining a connection with the program such as: Receiving ongoing updates from the program, which could include opportunities for future involvement in culture change efforts in DND/CAF Participating in the evaluation of the program Participating in research related to the program Sharing about their experience participating in RE, as part of program communications efforts During Phase 3, class members will have an opportunity to identify if they are interested to participate in a Circle process with executives from DND/CAF . There will only be a few of these circle processes throughout the lifespan of the program. If a class member is interested, they can let their restorative practitioner know and they may be contacted if the opportunity becomes available. Class member updates Read the latest updates sent to class members who have expressed an interest to participate in the Restorative Engagement Program. Fall 2024 Summer 2024 Spring 2024 Fall 2023 Summer 2023 March 2023 June 2022 March 2022 Defence representatives The Restorative Engagement Program is actively seeking Defence representatives to join the 2025 cohorts. We invite all CAF members and DND public service employees who are interested in playing a role in this culture change process within our institution to submit a nomination (only available on the National Defence Network). Defence representatives are CAF members and DND public service employees. Their work in the program is to first acknowledge and learn from the experiences and insights of those who have been harmed by sexual misconduct. Then, they plan and prepare to take meaningful action to contribute to culture change. Defence representatives commit to: listening with an open mind and considering multiple and conflicting perspectives participating actively in reflective learning activities learning to engage restoratively and without causing harm carrying what they learn forward into their career within the institution contributing to preventing sexual misconduct in the Defence Team and culture change beyond their time in this program Defence representatives participate in groups of 6 to 8 CAF members and DND public service employees of diverse professions, backgrounds, and identify factors. There are new flexible ways they can participate in the program. We call these groups cohorts. All following options were designed with awareness of the range of influence those ranks/levels have in contribution to culture change. Option 1 and 2 For Defence Team members of  any rank/level Designed for Defence representatives to learn skills to contribute to culture change in their own contexts across the whole institution Individual and group engagements Option 3: For senior leaders Designed for Defence representatives to learn skills to support culture change efforts by those they directly supervise Individual and possible group engagements Option 4: For executives Designed for Defence representatives to learn skills to support culture change efforts of those they supervise and at the institutional level Limited number of group engagements DR alumni community For alumni DRs Designed as an opportunity for alumni DRs to participate in engagements after their completion of one of the options Individual and group engagement Cohort work is facilitated by restorative practitioners. Defence representatives are essential agents of culture change that class members expect will occur through RE. To this end, Defence representative participation in the program has been carefully designed, using a restorative approach, to maximize Defence representative learning, planning and action, in real time. Defence representatives may engage with class members. Engagement sessions are one of several ways of learning in this program about sexual misconduct; they will have many opportunities to learn from class members’ experiences throughout the program (readings, videos, CM submissions, etc.). The Defence leadership’s role Members of the CAF chain of command and DND executives and management support implementation of the program by: promoting the recruitment of Defence representatives encouraging potential Defence representatives to take part by nominating them and by self-nominating to join a cohort providing Defence representatives with a confidential workplace and equipment ensuring that Defence representatives are not tasked with other duties during their participation in the full time portions of the program engaging with Defence representatives about what they’ve learned through the program, how they plan to take that forward in their career and into their workplace, and what they need from leadership to support their efforts in culture change supporting Defence representatives in carrying forward their action plan Restorative practitioners Restorative practitioners are DND public service employees. They are independent from the CAF chain of command. It is important to note that the role of restorative practitioners is to facilitate restorative processes/principles, assisting CMs and DRs in participating in the program and offering referrals to support services and resources, as needed. It is important to note that the role of restorative practitioners is to facilitate restorative processes/principles, assisting CMs and DRs in participating in the program and offering referrals  to support services and resources, as needed. Working with Defence representatives Restorative practitioners are assigned to facilitate each cohort of Defence representatives. They facilitate reflection, dialogue, learning, understanding, skills building, preparation, and planning for action. These cohort activities enable Defence representatives to identify lessons learned about sexual misconduct, develop restorative leadership skills, and build capacity for change. Working with class members Restorative practitioners work with class members to facilitate their participation in the program, including introducing the program (purpose, approach, and options); coordinating, preparing, and facilitating class member engagements with Defence representatives; bringing closure to their participation and referring to other programs and services as needed. Support services and resources Participating in the program can be very rewarding, and it can bring up difficult emotions. The restorative practitioner(s) assigned to you will facilitate you through the process and can connect you to other support services and resources, depending on your needs. At any time, you can contact the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre’s 24/7 confidential support line (1-844-750-1648) to reach a counsellor who has been briefed on the RE program. They can provide support and connect class members, Defence Team members and restorative practitioners to support services. Support can also come from a designated person that can be present during all stages of participation. Defence representatives can also reach out to other members of their cohort or to their management for support. Information sessions Request an information session to learn about the role of a Defence representative, the skill you will gain in becoming one and how to join the program. Send us feedback As a participant in the RE Program, you may raise your concerns, complaints, feedback or what you valued most regarding your participation, such as: program services, including those provided by a specific staff member (for example, a restorative practitioner or a regional program coordinator); program mandate and operations; program information and communications activities; reporting and information management.

Thank you very much for joining us. My name is Shoba Ranganathan and I am the Acting Executive Director of the Sexual Misconduct  Response Centre – also known as the SMRC . I have the distinct honour and  pleasure of leading us through today’s event and acting as your emcee. [Icons and symbols of Indigenous  communities on screen] Before we begin today’s event, I  would like to recognize that I am speaking to you today from Ottawa, the  traditional territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe Nation. We extend our  respect to all First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples for their valuable past  and present contributions to this land. The SMRC was  stood up in 2015 and first established support services, including the 24/7 support line and the Response and Support Coordination program, primarily for CAF members affected by sexual misconduct. Since then, under the leadership of Dr. Denise Preston, we have expanded our services to former CAF, DND public  servants, and in the near future, to family members as well. The purpose of  today’s event is to announce the launch of some new and expanded services  offered by the SMRC. Many important  projects have been underway over the last several months, and it is a true  honour to be here today to share these announcements with you. I would like to  express my sincere gratitude for the contributions which so many people have  made, not only recently but also in the past, which has made all of this  possible. The presenters  you will hear today come from our new programs, and they will be providing  details on each of these new services, including how and when you can  anticipate having access to them. Before hearing  from them, I would like to go over a few housekeeping items. First, I want to  encourage participants to listen to today’s session in their preferred  language. To access our simultaneous interpretation, please click on the  “Interpretation” button in the control bar at the bottom of the Zoom window –  and select your language of choice. Please note that interpretation  unfortunately is not possible for participants dialling in. [Interpretation instructions are  repeated in French] As you may have  noted on the registration confirmation email, this event is being recorded. Please rest assured that because  this is a webcast and not a standard ‘web meeting’, this is essentially a  one-way stream of communication and your anonymity is therefore protected. Only  panellists are being recorded, and the webcast functionality ensures that all  participant microphones will remain muted and cameras off. We also want to  assure you that we are not collecting personal information from this session,  and any information received – like the registered participants listed – will  be destroyed following the session. [ Text on-screen: Agenda. Opening remarks. Peer Support Model. Online Peer Support  Platform. Response and Support Coordination Program Expansion. Restorative  Engagement. Upcoming programs and initiatives. Questions and Answers. Closing  Remarks.] We will have time  at the end of the event today to answer your questions. Do not hesitate to  submit your questions throughout the event by clicking on the Q&A icon  located at the bottom or the top of your screen. Only the event host and  presenters will see your name and questions. However, when you do submit, you  can check off the “Send anonymously” button so that your name does not appear. Someone  from my team will moderate the questions and my team and I will do our best to  respond to as many as we can. [Shoba repeat  the instructions on how to submit questions in French] Finally, I want  to remind everyone attending today that if you are in need of support during or  after this session, we encourage you to speak with one of the SMRC’s Response  and Support counsellors in English or French toll-free at 1-844-750-1648. They  are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. On this note,  I am happy to begin the presentations about our new and expanded programs. Our  first presentation is Melissa Heimerl’s, National Program Manager of the Peer Support  Program at the SMRC. Melissa will first be speaking to you about our new peer  support model, and will then be joined by Lee Swain and Anne Gauthier,  representatives from a company called Togetherall, to talk about the launch of  an online peer support platform. Melissa, the floor is yours. [ Text on-screen: Military Sexual Trauma Peer  Support Program] ( Melissa Heimerl )  Thank you so much Shoba and thank you everyone for joining us today. My name  again is Melissa Heimerl and I am the National Program Manager for the MST Peer  Support Program at the SMRC. We are very excited to share with you today the  MST Peer Support Program model as well as our first program service, which will  be launched later today. I will begin  by providing a brief overview of SMRC’s peer support program model, which was  developed based on the consultations carried out with the community in  the fall of 2021. You can find the full report from this consultation on the  SMRC website. Afterwards, we will provide a demonstration of the first service  launch of our program: an online discussion forum called Togetherall. I would like to now show you the final  program visual for the MST Peer Support Program. [ Text on-screen: Program Model for Peer Support, includes one-on-one in person support,  in-person formal groups with mental health professionals, group virtual meeting  platforms, in-person informal groups, group discussion boards, one-on-one text  and chat mobile app, and one-on-one virtual meeting platform. Centre screen  reads: “You have the flexibility to change from one format to another at any  time”] This development  process was actualized as a result of the consultations held last fall and is  solely based on a program model that represented the service programming that  the community wanted to see. You will notice that the visual has 5 different  program options that we will be delivering as part of this program: The first  launch will be an online discussion forum called Togetherall, which I will  explain in further detail in a few minutes, and of which we will soon receive a  quick demonstration as well. The second is a  text and chat application called Confide,  which will allow the MST community to either text or chat with a counsellor on  the 24/7 line, or with a peer supporter once they are hired and engaged. The  app also has a wealth of resources compiled within it as well. The third  service will consist of individual support (in-person or online) by trained  peers, and will be facilitated by an external organization which will be  responsible for the hiring, recruitment, and training of these peers. This  approach, once again, stems from consultations we had with persons with lived experiences,  who recommended an approach that is independent from the program so that  community members would use it and have confidence in its process. The hiring  of this external organization is currently in the procurement process. The fourth service  will be informal groups. We will be launching two different group formats;  again, this approach was used due to the responses we received in the  consultations in the fall of 2021. The first group type will be an  informal peer support group, where members can come and go from the group as  needed, and will have a more informal approach led by two trained peer  facilitators, which again may be in-person or online. The second group  format is a formal peer support group. These groups will be led by a peer  facilitator but will be co-facilitated by a mental health professional in order  to do psycho-education with the group, and to help manage any group dynamics  that may emerge. These groups will have a start and finish date with the same  peers throughout, and again may be available in-person or online. The last service  offering of the program was also recommended to us during consultations. It  consists of informal activities between peers on behalf of the clients who  already have access to the program, for example, a hike or an equine therapy  day. These activities are only potentially considered for now, this is why they  are not depicted in the model at the moment. We want to ensure that the  selection processes are appropriate for these types of activities before they  are implemented. We would like to thank the community once again today for  sharing their comments with us last fall, and we are confident that this model  reflects the services needed to fill this critical gap. [ Text on-screen: Initial Programming Launch Online  Platform: Discussion Board. 1. The MST community needed assistance first and  foremost to replace existing online discussion groups. 2. Previous platforms  were difficult to manage and to ensure confidentiality and anonymity of users.  3. The MST Peer Support Discussion board will be available as a main peer  support priority to help replace these previously used platforms.] I would now like  to further explain to you our first program service launching today which is an  online discussion board platform. As we understood it, the community was in  need of an online peer-to-peer platform that would ensure the anonymity and  confidentiality of users that would also have clinical moderation 24/7. We also  heard loud and clear that the preference was for this service to be at arm’s  length from the Government of Canada. We therefore prioritized this as our  phase 1 launch for programming for the MST Peer Support Program. The SMRC carried  out an environmental analysis and found a third-party company that will be able  to offer this service to our users. I would now like to welcome Mr. Lee Swain and  Ms. Anne Gauthier, who will guide us through a demonstration of how this  application operates, and the way in which it will provide an essential service  to our community. Lee and Anne, I’m going to hand it over to you. [ Text on-screen: Togetherall logo. Under the name and title of Lee Swain, Head of Account  Management, NA and Anne Gauthier, Bilingual Senior Clinical Moderator.] ( Lee Swain ) Thank  you so much Melissa. Good afternoon everybody. My name is Lee Swain, I use  he/him pronouns and I am the head of account management with Togetherall and  we’re happy to be here with you today. I'm going to let my colleague Anne  introduce herself. ( Anne Gauthier ) Hello everyone, it is a  pleasure to be a part of today’s demonstration. My name is Anne Gauthier I am a  bilingual clinical moderator at Togetherall. [Anne  reintroduces herself in French] In brief, my role  at Togetherall is to ensure the clinical safety of our members on the platform  within a multidisciplinary team of clinicians. [Anne repeats  her role in French] If at any point  in the demonstration with Lee and I you have any questions, do not hesitate. If  you have any questions, I am happy to answer in French or in English. I will take it  back to Lee for the rest of the demonstration now. ( Lee Swain ) Great,  thank you so much Anne. To give you a bit of background on Togetherall, as  Melissa mentioned we are an online peer support platform. We have been in place  for fifteen years and currently work with the British military. We also work  with the province of Alberta and the province of Nova Scotia, and the Wellness  Together Canada initiative through Health Canada. We function around the idea  of the value of the community as it relates to mental well-being, and obviously  the SMRC recognizes that in developing a peer support model. [ Text on-screen: The  Power of a Community of Support. The benefits: Sharing, supporting,  normalization, lived experience, belonging. Barriers preventing people from  seeking support: Isolation and withdrawal, stigma, access, mental health  literacy. But High demand for digital support communities: 1.9 million+ mental  health support groups on Reddit, 2.5 million+ mental health support groups on  Facebook, 344 million+ mental health #hashtags on Instagram, and 23.1 billion+  mental health #hashtags on Tik Tok] There are a  number of benefits to having peer support: the ability to share and normalize  what people are experiencing and get support from others through that function  of sharing lived experience can help create an incredible sense of belonging  and support which we know is very important in terms of mental wellness, and is  a supportive protective factor when it comes to mental health. We also know  there’s lots of reasons people don’t seek support, in-person support for mental  wellbeing and that could be because they feel isolated, they might have stigma  associated with it, and that’s particularly true for individuals who have  experienced sexual misconduct. There’s often stigma associated with that. There  might be legitimate reasons why someone can’t access care; it could be  distance, it could be a lack of resources, and that is why I think it’s really  good that the SMRC is creating a peer support model that offers many options  for people to access so that there are multiple doors people can access at  their level of comfort. We’re excited to be the first phase 1 part of that  launch. We do know that,  online, in terms of people reaching out for peer support, in many social media  platforms there’s an incredible amount of outreach where people are seeking  help and support from others on more traditional social media platforms, and to  that end, Togetherall has created, in essence, a social media platform that  includes asynchronous message boards and opportunities to connect with others,  but in a safer, clinically moderated way. [ Text on-screen: Who  we are: An accessible (immediate access, available 24/7, mobile first), safe  (24/7 clinically moderated, anonymous, risk escalation processes), and vibrant  (20+ million have access, 300,000+ supported, 300+ commissioning orgs)  community.] Like other peer  support platforms, everyone has immediate access. You can sign up, you don’t need  to be prescribed by the SMRC and you don’t need a special link. They will be  providing information on how to access the platform. It is available 24/7, it  is a web-based platform but it’s built mobile first so it works well on phones,  tablets, and any device. It is anonymous,  which we think is really important for a number of reasons but depending upon  somebody’s comfort speaking about their mental health, we know that anonymity  makes it more comfortable for people to do that. We also know that 55% of  people on our platform have shared something for the first time because of that  anonymity and that level of comfort they feel. It is also  clinically moderated 24 hours a day, seven days a week by people like Anne and  our other clinical moderators who are constantly monitoring the platform and  making sure that that anonymity is protected, that there is no breach of  anonymity, but also that if there are any indicators of risk by any of the  members that are on the platform, they are able to reach out, help assess that  risk, offer supportive resources and escalate that risk to emergency services  if needed. Anne will talk about that a little bit later but I wanted to share  that here. It is important  for everybody here to know that nothing we collect from you is shared. As  Melissa mentioned, since we’re a third party, we will collect some registration  information from you when you join the platform. We will also obviously  moderate that risk and monitor for risks, but we do not share any of that  content or information back to the SMRC, the Government of Canada, the DND or  VAC. It’s all kept by us and really just used for our purposes. I did also want  to share a sense of the size of the community. We work with varying commission  organizations, like the SMRC, who provide the service for their populations. We  have more than 300 commissioning bodies, more than 300,000 people are supported  on the platform and more than 20 million have access. When you join the  platform, you are interacting with people from around the world; you are  interacting with people from the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia,  and Ireland, so English-speaking countries, mostly, and it allows for that  large amount of anonymity and protection. But there are ways to hone in on the  people you want to talk to and connect with around your personal lived  experience and I’ll explain that in the demo. I’m going to  switch over to another screen. [ Text on-screen: Login  page for Togetherall] When you log into  Togetherall, you are asked to create an anonymous username. Here [ Text on-screen: Shows username or email address field] I've created one for the purposes of  this presentation. Also, when you  register you are asked if you want to choose the English community or the  French community, so for our Canadian members we do have a French community,  and because they are separate communities I'm only going to be demonstrating  the English community today, but know that everything I show you is duplicated  within the French community and works in the same way. [ Text on-screen: Home  page for Togetherall Reads: “A safe space, where people provide peer-to-peer  emotional support, health, and guidance.” Top of the news feed is visible, with  control including Categories, Type of Post, and Create Post] When I log into  the platform, I am brought into the home page which is very much like other  social media platforms in that it is an infinite scroll of the latest activity  that is within the platform. There are three main parts to the platform: the  peer community [Points to the community tab with icons of two conversation  bubbles], which is really core to this effort, providing an opportunity to  connect with others who have similar lived experiences and who you want to  connect with for support. That is core to our program, but there also courses [Points  to the courses tab with an icon of glasses] and resources [Points to the  resources tab with an icon of a book]. This home page pulls together all three  elements of the platform and so I'm going to talk about each first and then  come back to this home page. [Clicks on  community icon] Within the peer support community, again, when I click in here  it is similarly the latest activity on the platform, and as a member I can  choose to create a post and share how I'm feeling, and there's a couple of ways  I can do that. I can click here [Clicks on Create a post] and create a post,  and we have three different types of posts that you can create. [ Text on-screen: After  clicking “Create Post” button, the screen reads “How do you want to share your thoughts?”  Options are “Write a Talkabout,” “Create a Brick,” and “Group Talkabout”] One is called a  Talkabout, it is basically a text-based post. [Clicks on “Write  a Talkabout”] I would be able  to write a post title [Points to the Insert post title field] about how I’m  feeling. I’m able to share what is going on for me, what I’m experiencing here  within this box [Points to a field text box titled What’s on your mind?] and  then I am able to select categories that apply to what I am talking about. I  can click here [Clicks on the Categories field] and these are commonly used  tags, you can see anxiety, depression, trauma, relationships, loneliness  [Complete list of categories shown on screen include Anxiety, Depression, General  Chat, Recovery, Relationships, Stress, Loneliness, Student Experience, Sleep,  PTSD/Trauma, Anger and Choose from other categories], but if I click on choose  from other categories, you can see that there is a much longer list of  categories I can choose from too [Other categories shown on screen include  Abuse, Addiction, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Body Image, COVID-19, Cultural  Identity, Disability, Eating, Eco-anxiety, Gender Identity, Gender/Sexuality,  Grief/Loss, Happiness, Illness, Inequality, Money Management, OCD,  Parenthood/Parenting, Phobias, Pregnancy, Psychosis, Race/Ethnicity,  Relaxation/Mindfulness, Religion/Religious Identity, Seasonal Affective  Disorder, Self-Harm, Working from Home], and it is a multi-select tool so you  can select multiple categories that relate to what you’re posting about. I  would then type what I’m feeling and post my Talkabout [Clicks on the button  Post your Talkabout], and that would post it to the community, inviting others  on the platform to weigh in and offer support and validation for how I’m  feeling. [ Text on-screen: Returns to the previous page, selects “Create a Brick”] A second type of  post is called a Brick, it is similar in a lot of ways in that you still put a  title to your post [Points to the Insert post title field], you are still able  to select categories for your post [Clicks on the Categories field], but there  are also simplified drawing tools within the platform that allow me to  creatively express myself as a member. Maybe I am not able to put what I’m  feeling into words, but I am able to type some things in colour if I choose to  [Clicks on the text tool], I am able to paint [Clicks on the paint brush tool] and  draw with different colours and with different tools, I can also upload images  related to how I feel [Clicks on the upload image tool]. Again, in  uploading images, since it’s an anonymous platform, we certainly wouldn’t want  people to upload any image that would indicate or be revealing as to an  identity, but maybe, as you’ll see later when I show other parts of the  platform, people may upload images of scenes that relate to how they’re  feeling. I still can write a text-based caption if I choose to here to include  with my post [Points to a text box field titled Description (optional)], and  then I would post that to the platform [Clicks on Create a Brick]. Again  [Clicks on the Go Back link], this is just a way some people choose to  creatively express how they’re feeling rather than in text, and some people do  this on a daily basis, just create an image as part of their recovery  journey. ( Melissa Heimerl )  Lee, is there a way to increase the font size for those who might be visually  impaired? ( Lee Swain ) I can  do that, is that better? ( Melissa Heimerl )  Yes, thank you. ( Lee Swain ) I can  also create a third type of post called a Group Talkabout [Points to the Group  Talkabout]. Over time as you’re engaging in the community, you may get into a  back-and-forth conversation with another member, you can choose to add them as  a friend within the platform [Points to the Friends icon on the top right  corner of the screen]. It is still an anonymous friend, we do not allow you to  share personally identifiable information with other members but you can add  them as a friend, you are able to direct message them if you choose to [Points  to the Messages icon on the top right corner of the screen], and you can also  create what’s called a Group Talkabout [Clicks on Group Talkabout]. So if there is a  specific topic, you’d like to talk about but you don’t want it to be posted  publicly on the public message board, you are able to create a Talkabout here  [Points to the Insert post title field, Categories field and What’s on your  mind? text box field], just like you would other Talkabouts, and then add  members that you consider to be friends [Points to the Members field]. If for instance,  you wanted to speak about your lived experience with sexual misconduct but you  didn’t want to share that in the public message board, you could create a  private group here where only the people you chose to see that message would be  able to see it. It is important for you to know, however, that even things  within the private Group Talkabout are still visible to our Wall Guides and  clinical team. Nothing within the platform is hidden from them so even within  those private group Talkabouts, we ask that you don't share any personally  identifiable information, and if there are any indicators of risk, our clinical  team will reach out [Clicks on Go Back]. If I go back to  the community, as a member often I might not feel comfortable posting right  away so I could just choose to read what other people are saying. [Scrolls through  news feed] Here is a  Talkabout post [Points to an existing Talkabout post]. You can see somebody's  talking about their inner turmoil. They have tagged it anxiety, depression,  relationships, and anger and this is their anonymous username, @puddlediver. I  could click into this post [Clicks on Talkabout post],and read what they're  sharing, I could read how other people have weighed in and offered support, see  a couple of people have done that here @hopscotchporcupine, @potatoprints, and  then as a user I could also offer support. We know that it  can actually be really therapeutic to offer support to others, so I could add  my own comment here [Points to the Add a new comment field]. I could also star  this posted if I want to favourite it and come back to it later [Points to a  star icon titled Star post on the right hand side of the screen], and remember  what people said. I can turn on notifications for the post [Points to a bell  with a strike icon titled Turn on notifications icon on the right hand side of  the screen] if I want to hear other advice or new activity within this post; it  would then ping me up here in my notifications section. I can also report a  post [Points to a flag icon titled Report post], which would send a note to a  clinician if I have concerns about what is included here. Maybe I feel like  it's not a supportive post, maybe I feel concerned for the member, maybe I feel  that this person is bullying or trolling in the platform, I could use this  report post button as well. [Points to “Ask a  Wall Guide” icon in the bottom right of the screen] I'm also able, as  a member, to ask the Wall Guide –  at any point down here at the bottom right I can ask a question and that would  open a direct message conversation with a Wall Guide. That could be about  navigating the platform; that could also be about concerns. So Anne maybe you  want to share a little bit about when a clinician intervenes, what are the  types of reasons clinicians might intervene and what that process looks  like. [Screen returns  to Home page] ( Anne Gauthier ) Absolutely  Lee. So in many cases, in the clinical role at Togetherall, we are  constantly monitoring for risk and, in particular, if a member posts any  content that may seem concerning or is an indicator of risk towards the member,  towards another member within the Togetherall platform. Within the team we  would assess the urgency of the risk involved whether that's a community post,  whether that's a community brick, and from there we would take additional steps  including steps related to reaching out to the member within their direct  messages. We can additionally provide members with additional resources; we can  request further information on the member’s safety and in certain instances we  could escalate the member to emergency services. But within the platform, all  risk is moderated 24/7 as we mentioned, and a lot of the keywords do pop up on  our end; as clinicians we would have that visibility to take a look to  understand if it is a priority or if it is urgent and then act from  there. ( Lee Swain ) And  it is important to point out our clinical moderators are that; they're moderators,  they're not counselors. They do not engage in therapy with members of the  platform, but they are there to connect with other resources and other services  that might be able to help with that. [Emphasizes the Mid-screen  Tool Bar] Going back to the  main community page, a couple of other things I want to point out. You are able  to revisit your own posts here [Points to the My posts tab], you can revisit  any post that you've starred here [Points to the Starred tab]. If I don't want  to scroll through this whole feed of the latest activity, I can also filter by  those categories [Clicks on the filter button that provides a list of popular  categories such as Anxiety, Depression, General Chat, Recovery and  Relationships with an option of showing more categories]. The reason people tag  those categories is it helps members find other posts related to the topics  that they want to see. If I want to read about anxiety and addiction, I can  click those two links and hit OK and it will filter out the feed just for those  types of posts, so you are able to filter by any of the categories that are  present there. I can also filter my type of post if I choose [clicks on the  Type of post button that shows View all, Brick, Talkabout], to either a brick  or Talkabout. One other thing I  want to share is the concept of groups. When you click into groups [Clicks on  Groups Beta] you will see any private Group Talkabout that you're part of, that  you've been invited to, that you're engaged in with others, but we also have a  number of groups that you can join. [Selects “See all  Groups” at the bottom right corner of the Group’s page] Some of these are  wellness-based groups which are topical, there's a space to share health and  lifestyle tips, to share humour, to share gratitude, as we know sharing those  types of things can be helpful for one’s mental health journey. [Scrolls  downwards] But particularly,  I want to point out down here some role-based groups, and there is a military  community so if you want to connect only with other individuals who are  affiliated with military service in some way, you can do that. [Clicks on the  group titled “Military Community”] When you click  here, it functions just like the main message board that I demonstrated except  you're only posting to others with that military experience. [Clicks x next to  previously selected “Addiction” and “Anxiety” filters to clear them] I’m just clearing  those filters to give you an idea. Here I would create a post in the same way  that I did before but within this military community. It is only posting to  other people have opted into that military community. That's one of the ways  you can hone in on others with similar lived experiences. I want to share  two other parts of the platform. Within the resources section [Clicks on the  book-shaped icon for the “Resources” tool, in the tool bar at the top left of  the screen], there are a couple of tools that are helpful. There's a private  journaling tool [Points to the Journal tool], a goal setting tool [Points to  Goal setter tool] which can be helpful in trying to change behaviours.  Sometimes you might not feel comfortable posting to the community but you want  to get your thoughts down in private; you can do that here. Again, Wall Guides  would see this so if you're journaling about self-harm or suicidal ideation or  something like that, they are going to reach out and offer support. There are also a  number of clinically validated self-assessments you can take here [Scrolls  downwards, four self-assessment tools are presented. These pertain to General  distress, Loss or Trauma, Self-esteem, and Anxiety about health], and if you  assess severe or moderately severe a Wall Guide will also reach out, again, to  offer support in a supportive way if you want their help. When you log in,  there are three specific resources. [Scrolls  downwards, three articles are presented. They are entitled CFMAP, SMRC, and  SMRC Search Tool] There will be the  EAP or support line associated with whether or not you're a serving CAF member,  a veteran or former CAF member, a DND public service employee or family or a  supporter who would be the family information line. Those would be linked here [Points  to CFMAP on the screen] and then you'll see a link to the SMRC itself, as well  as the SMRC search tool where you can search for other supports around sexual  misconduct by region. In addition to  those three resources, if I click view all [Clicks on View all button] there  are a number of self-help articles that you can read to increase your knowledge  around different topics, and you are able to sort and filter them by those same  categories. So if I only wanted to read about depression, I could click on the  “Depression” filter and it would just pull up the self-help articles related to  depression. [Clicks on the  glasses-shaped icon for the “Courses” tool, in the tool bar on the top left of  the screen. Scrolls downwards through the various course offerings.] The last piece I  want to share is Courses. The courses themselves are rooted in Cognitive  Behavioural Therapy principles so it's about behavior change. There are some  around managing anger, there are some around veterans’ grief and loss,  veterans’ PTSD, PTSD in general, depression, and again you can load more to see  more, but each of these is modular and self-paced so you work through them at  whatever speed you would like to. We do also  leverage elements of the resources so sometimes you will be asked to take a  self-assessment, sometimes you will be asked to use that journaling or  goal-setting tool as part of these courses, and we also leverage the peer  community. [Clicks on the “Home” icon in the tool bar at the top left corner of  the screen.] For each of these courses, there is a group conversation for  people who are taking the course or have completed the course where you can  share with others on how it's working for you, what you're learning, how you're  trying to change your behavior, and get support for that. Those are the  three main sections of the course. I brought us back here to the main news feed  which again pulls in all of the recent posts, but as you scroll down you'll see  here’s a self-help article about looking after yourself during COVID-19. If I  scroll further down, here's a course. So it's reminding users, as they filter  through this news feed, of the other resources that are available in addition  to the community posts themselves. [Selects the  “Filters” tool in the middle-right section of the screen. A pop-up screen shows  a variety of topics to avoid or include in filters] Here you are able  to also filter by those different categories. If there are certain categories  that are triggering to you, maybe there are certain things you do not want to  read about or maybe you only want to read about certain topics. For each of  those tags, you can choose to avoid or include them in your news feed and then  you will only see the content that you feel is relevant to you and that you  feel is safe for you to read. The last thing  I'll share very quickly is what we call the wall [Clicks on the “Explore the  wall” icon in the top right section of the home page. A grid of rectangular  “Brick” posts compiled to form a “Wall” is presented, made up by various  artistic expressions posted by community members.] and this is the way that we  pull together all of those visual brick posts. That's why we call them bricks,  so that makes a little more sense, we pull them into a wall. You're able to  drag around the wall and see what visual posts are interesting to you and click  into them. [Clicks on a blue  and yellow brick post] If I see a post  and I'm curious about what it means or it resonates with me, I'm able to see  that @zazz1234 has posted this about sunshine. Again, sometimes  people are doing this as part of their daily recovery – drawing something, making something  creative, making some art –  as part of the recovery journey and they're doing that here. When you open a  brick from the wall, it opens just like it does in the community. You can do  all the same things you did before; you can comment, you can star the post,  report the post, whatever you might want to do. [Returns to the  Home Page] So that is a  quick summary of the platform itself. I do want to show you how to register.  The MST peer support program will share these links with you all. [Switches  tabs to the Togetherall registration page.] There is an  English registration page and a French registration page [Changes tabs to show  the registration page]. On each one, you will see some background on the  service, some more information about the service if you'd like. Down at the  bottom there's some frequently asked questions; we’ll get to questions, of  course, at the end of today's session but there are also more frequently asked  questions here [Scrolls down the bottom of the page and points out the  questions in the French platform]. There are four  registration buttons [Points to the four registration buttons on the French  platform: Vous êtes un membre des Forces armées canadiennes (FAC)? (Canadian Armed Forces Member?) Vous êtes un  vétéran/ancien membre des FAC? (Veteran/Former CAF member?) Vous êtes une  employée ou un employé de la fonction publique du MDN? (DND Public Service Employee?) Vous êtes membre de la famille ou un proche? (Family Member or  Supporter?)]. and you would choose the button that is applicable for  you, so if you're a serving CAF member, if you’re a former CAF member, a DND  public service employee or a family member or supporter, you would choose the  registration pathway that is appropriate for you. [Clicks on the “ Joignez-vous dès aujourd’hui ” (Join  Today) button] If I click on  that link, this will then take me to the registration page [Registration page  shows Create account followed by Check if Togetherall is available to you and  two fields: Which describes you? With I’d like to search for my organization in  the field and Find eligible organization with Forces armées canadiennes –  Membres de la famille et sympathisants (Canadian Armed Forces – Family Member  or Supporter) in the field] and you will be asked for (it's not letting me, I'm  already logged in) but basically would then be asked for an e-mail address, a  phone number, a postal code. That is the only personally identifiable  information that we collect from you and we only use it in the event of risk  escalation. That information is never shared with SMRC or anybody at the  Government of Canada. Once you click submit, you'll receive an activation e-mail  to then complete your registration, that's how we verify that you're a real  person, and then you will be able to access the platform after answering a  couple of demographic questions and presenting issues and  conditions. I'm going to stop  there because I think we're out of time, but know that Anne and I are both  sticking around to the end to answer questions you might have about the  platform, so I’ll pass it back over to Melissa. ( Melissa Heimerl )  Thank you, Anne and Lee. [Returns to  SMRC’s slide deck. Screen reads: Interested in getting involved? Email us at SMRCPSP-CISSPSP@forces.gc.ca ] We’d like to  thank you again for your attendance today as we discussed the plan for the MST  Peer support Program and we hope this will be a valuable service to the  community. We will continue to update you on the phased launches of the other  parts of the peer support program through our SMRC website and social media  platforms. You will also find there today the versions of the models as well as  registration links to register with the Togetherall application. You can also  email us at our positional mailbox if you have any questions, feedback, or  interest in the peer support program itself. I would now like to welcome my  colleague, Elizabeth Cyr – Manager of the Response and Support Coordination  Program – to share her program announcements. Thank you. ( Elizabeth Cyr ) Thank  you, Melissa. Good afternoon. Today, we are very pleased to be making an  announcement about the Response and Support Coordination Program. Before I get  into details, I want to first give you some context about the Response and  Support Coordination Program – which I will refer to from now on as the ‘ RSC Program.’ The RSC Program  is one of the programs of the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre or SMRC. It  neither reports through nor to the Chain of Command – it is truly an initiative  that has been set up to meet the needs of those who have experienced sexual  misconduct. It is separate from, but works alongside, the SMRC’s 24/7 support  line. In the context of  this program, people who have experienced sexual misconduct are paired with a  case coordinator who provides them with support, assistance, and help with  navigating the systems, as per their own situation. Given that each person has  unique and specific needs and objectives in relation to their experience, the  coordinator works in collaboration with the person to develop an approach which  prioritizes their needs and objectives first. [ Text on-screen: RSC  Program graphic is shared, the 6 components include liaison and coordination,  practical assistance, accompaniment, workplace arrangements, information and  referrals, and support] It is not  necessary for the person to have officially reported their experience with  sexual misconduct nor to have any intention to do so in order to get access to  the program. Nevertheless, if they have reported it or if they intend to, the  coordinator can accompany them through this process. The RSC Program  has been in place for about three years, since the summer of 2019. It began as  a program for currently serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces who had  experienced sexual misconduct. As of last fall, the Program grew to also serve  former members and veterans, as well as public service employees of the Department  of National Defence. Since its launch,  the RSC Program has been offered from a central location to individuals across  Canada and worldwide. But recent funding has allowed us to start working on the  next phase of the program, which includes hiring staff in different locations  across Canada to set up regional locations. This brings me to  today’s announcement, which is the fruit of this work. Today, I have the great  pleasure to share with you the official launch of the first three regions of  the Response and Support Coordination program: the regions of Quebec, the  Pacific, which includes the Province of British Columbia and the Yukon  Territory, and the National Capital, which includes the Ottawa-Gatineau region,  as well as the Nunavut Territory. Staff have been  hired in these regions so that persons who have experienced sexual misconduct  can work with a coordinator who is familiar with their particular geographical  context and who is capable of assisting them at a more local level. Having staff  right in those regions will increase in-person support; help Coordinators build  relationships both within and outside the military at a local and regional  level; and help raise awareness about the Program. Regional Coordinators will  be better aware of the specific cultures and realities that people face where  they are. We started with  three regions to learn and adapt, so that we are as responsive as possible. We  want to get this right. We are working to ensure that the remaining three regions:  Atlantic, Ontario and the Prairies, will be open over the next year. In the  meantime, we have Coordinators in place who will continue to provide services  and support individuals no matter where they are – across the country and  worldwide – until all of the regions are fully operating. I want to leave  you with a few thoughts about the RSC Program. We know that word-of-mouth is  really important in terms of letting people know about the services that are  available to them. The RSC program  works to uphold the dignity and respect of those who have experienced sexual  misconduct. We recognize and affirm the diversity of our clients and meet every  person where they are to support them around their specific lived realities,  goals, and needs. Always with the  person’s consent, Coordinators work with other service providers, members of  the Chain of Command and managers, to remove barriers, help clients get  information or access services, and ensure their needs are heard, understood  and considered. This can also include working together to set up workplace  arrangements that meet their needs. Finally,  Coordinators can accompany clients to appointments, meetings or events, to  support them. For example, they could be present at meetings with police, during  legal or administrative proceedings, or at a meeting with their  supervisor. We invite you to  inform the people whom you think might be interested about our regional  expansion. This expansion is largely due to the people with lived experiences  of sexual misconduct who have so clearly expressed the necessity of a regional  model, in order to better meet their needs. We thank you for your engagement. Those interested  in joining or learning more about the program are invited to call the SMRC 24/7  line, which is the point of entry for the program. A counsellor will explain  the program’s offerings and can refer you to a coordinator, in accordance with  your location and your preferred official language. Thank you very  much. I will now hand it over to my colleague, Nadia Lécuyer. [ Text on-screen: Restorative  Engagement Program] ( Nadia Lécuyer ) Thank  you, and hello everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us. I will be  speaking to you today briefly about the Restorative Engagement Program, the  Duty to Report exception, and the impact of this exception on the  program. [ Text on-screen: Restorative  Engagement Program. Part of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) / Department of  National Defence (DND) Sexual Misconduct Class Action Settlement. A  collaboration between the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre and Integrated  Conflict and Complaint Management. Supported by internal and external  stakeholders and subject matter experts.] The Restorative  Engagement program is part of the Canadian Armed Forces-Department of National  Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Final Settlement Agreement. It was designed  by the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre in collaboration with Integrated  Conflict and Complaint Management and in consultation with internal and  external stakeholders, affected persons, and subject matter experts. The goal is to assist class members interested in sharing  their experiences and/or their ideas related to sexual misconduct with  representatives from the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National  Defence, as well as contributing to the improvement of institutional responses  to sexual misconduct and to changing the culture that promotes it. [ Text on-screen: Purpose of  Restorative Engagement. Create supportive sharing opportunities for class  members. Create learning opportunities for representatives of the DND/CAF.  Identify the lessons learned and take action toward broader culture change  efforts across the DND. Model, learn about, and build capacity for the use of a  principle-based restorative approach.] More  specifically, the objectives of the Restorative Engagement program are as  follows: Giving class members the option of choosing which aspects of their  experiences, their knowledge, or  their understanding of sexual misconduct they’d like to share, including its  causes and impacts. Secondly, to create opportunities for CAF and DND representatives to  recognize, understand, and learn from the experiences and knowledge of the class  members, and to assume both individual and collective responsibility  for its causes and institutional responses. A third objective of the program is to create opportunities for class  members and Defence representatives to identify lessons learned  and to take action, in real time, to contribute to broader institutional  culture change efforts; and lastly, to Model, learn about, and build capacity for the use of restorative  approaches as a response to harm and as a way to build an inclusive  and respectful institutional culture, now and into the future. The Restorative  Engagement Program was launched on November 15th, 2021, and is in its initial  phase. What this means is that the initial group of class members contacted to  participate during this initial phase will be small (about 150-250) in order to  ensure that all of the necessary resources, supports and systems are in  place. Engagement  between class members and Defence Team representatives has begun, and the feedback  from the first participants up to now has been extremely positive. The team is  committed to continually ensuring that the program is flexible and agile in  order to achieve its goals and objectives, as well as to remain receptive of  the needs of class members. One area of concern  in launching the program was the application of Duty to Report. Class members,  affected persons, members of the SMRC external advisory council, voiced their  concerns that the Duty to Report could come into play depending on what  information would be shared with CAF representatives in the  program. [ Text on-screen: Duty to Report. On 25 May 2022, the Minister of National  Defence amended the QR&Os to create an exception to the Duty to Report  within the context of a Restorative Engagement Program. This means that Duty to  Report will not be acted on should a class member decide to share details  during their participation in the RE program.] Through this  incredible advocacy, I am thrilled to say that on May 25th, 2022,  the Minister of National Defence amended the Queen’s Regulations & Orders  to create an exception to the Duty to  Report within the context of a Restorative Engagement Program. This means that  there will be no obligation to report if a class member decides to share  details during their participation in the program. As mentioned, the  Restorative Engagement program seeks to assist class members in sharing their  experiences, knowledge, and/or understanding of sexual misconduct. The class  members can decide on what to share in the context of the program, and now,  with no concern about the duty to report. The Restorative  Engagement program was not intended, nor designed, to address individual  accountability, which is one of the purposes of Duty to Report. The intent and  spirit of the program is to enable sharing in a safe, supportive and  confidential environment. The amendment  will not limit a class member’s ability to report; it will rather ensure that  the CAF representatives, who have volunteered to listen, recognize, and learn,  are not put in a position where they are obligated to report the incidents of  misconduct. It is our hope  that this amendment will allow the program to be delivered as it was intended. Thank  you. ( Shoba  Ranganathan ) Thank you, Nadia, Elizabeth, Melissa and the Togetherall  team. The development of the MST Peer Support Program, the  expansion of the RSC program, and the work the team has done towards the  exception for the duty to report are some of the examples of the  existing work that has been ongoing to increase support to the community of  people affected by sexual misconduct in the CAF and DND. They are also tangible examples of the department’s  commitment to implement the recommendations of the Independent External  Comprehensive Review. By strengthening these programs, we are taking action to  evolve the SMRC’s role to provide resources for victims and survivors of sexual  misconduct; facilitate immediate access to legal assistance to victims of  sexual misconduct across the country; and enhance the role and structure of the  SMRC. To conclude these  presentations, I am pleased to share that what we have spoken about today only  reflect a few of the SMRC’s upcoming initiatives. [ Text on-screen: Upcoming Programs and Initiatives.] Today’s session  has shed light on some of the new SMRC services which were immediately ready to  be announced. However, we plan to organize another information session near the  end of summer 2022 to share additional details on many other programs and  services which we are preparing to offer in the months to come. Without giving  too much away before these initiatives are ready for a full-scale launch, I  would like to provide you with a little sneak peek at what’s ahead. [ Text on-screen: Upcoming Programs and Initiatives. Expansion of the  existing Sexual Assault Centre Contribution Program to a Grant Program.  Development of an Independent Legal Advice Program. New Partnership and  Engagement team. Launch of a mobile application for text and chat support.] I am happy to  share that we will be launching a Grant  Program. This will expand the existing Sexual Assault Contribution  Program which funds projects from civilian sexual assault centres, to make it  more responsive to the needs of those with lived experiences. The new Grant  Program takes a broader approach and seeks to support survivors of sexual  assault in the wider CAF community by increasing access to services and  resources. Two types of  grants will be available to eligible not-for-profit community-based service  providers: one-time funding of up to $50,000 per project, and recurrent funding  of up to $75,000 per year. Funding will be  available for a wide range of potential projects and initiatives. I am talking  here about the production of research related to supporting persons affected by  sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, the creation of support groups,  and the provision of support services adapted to the needs of diverse  underserved people and groups, such as women, men, LGBTQ+ communities and  gender diverse communities, among others. I also want to speak about the new legal support  services that SMRC will be launching in the near future. The access of legal advice  is a significant gap in survivor support. To address this gap, the SMRC’s  Independent Legal Advice Program will provide legal information, advice and  legal representation to people with lived experiences of military sexual  misconduct. The goal will be  to provide services which respond to the needs of victims and survivors, in  order to give them the means to make informed decisions. Under a temporary  benefit model, the SMRC with reimburse victims for the cost of legal fees  incurred. A complete and permanent program model, taking feedback from people  with lived experiences into account, will be implemented next. The next item  that I look forward to sharing with you at our next session relates to the  advancements made on the SMRC’s approach to Partnership and Engagement. A dedicated  Partnership and Engagement team has been developed and is working diligently to  draft a new robust stakeholder engagement framework to guide all engagement  activities. The Partnership  and Engagement team strives to reimagine partnership and stakeholder engagement  by expanding the availability of feedback methods. This team will  serve as a hub for all engagement activities and will ensure that consultations  are safe, thoughtful, coordinated, and inclusive. These principles will help  guide enduring partnerships with people with lived experiences of sexual  misconduct as well as the wider stakeholder community. As mentioned in  our Peer Support Program model, the SMRC is also planning to launch a mobile application that will  serve as a centralized online portal for support services and resources. The mobile  application is being designed and tailored specifically for the SMRC.  Initially, it will offer access to text and chat functionality which will allow  users to connect virtually with an SMRC counsellor, and then will later be the  platform to connect peers with peer supporters as part of the overall peer  support program. This application  is linked to a wealth of information and supplementary resources and will  include an integration with the Respect in the Canadian Armed Forces (RitCAF)  application, which is already available. This service will  be offered not only to active members but also to former members, as well as to  public service staff at DND and to their families. Finally, I would  like to say that SMRC is taking proactive measures to reinforce its  independence. We are enthusiastic about the idea of providing you with further  details on this subject, as well as on all the other programs and services that  I have just mentioned, during our next information session. [ Text on-screen: Thank  you! If you have any feedback on this presentation, please send it to SMRC.Partnerships-Partenariats.CIIS@forces.gc.ca ] But more importantly, I would like to thank each of  you for participating and joining us today. We thank you for your thoughtful  questions and your continued support and patience as we work towards preparing  these programs for launch. The SMRC is proud  to adopt a trauma-informed, survivor-centred approach in its work. We hope that  events like this one will continue to expand our reach within our community  with the goal of being more inclusive and representative of the diversity we  know exists within the Defence Team and the people with lived experiences of  military sexual misconduct.

These include Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members, Veterans/former CAF members, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets and Junior Canadian Rangers, 18 years and older. On this page Definition Creating a Peer Support Program Meet the peer support team Get involved Definition Peer support is the giving and receiving of emotional support among people who share a common experience. It offers a safer space where peers affected are believed and their experiences validated. It also promotes a sense of: belonging; encouragement; solidarity; healing; empowerment and resilience. Creating a Peer Support Program People affected by sexual misconduct and MST report that the specific DND/CAF aspects of their experiences are not always well understood by external civilian practitioners or service providers. They often describe feelings of isolation when seeking support services. Many people who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or MST through their service or in their place of work and those who work to support them, have requested the development of a Peer Support Program as outlined in the External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces report (the Deschamps Report) published in 2015. This program supports CAF members, former CAF members/Veterans, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets, Junior Canadian Rangers, 18 years and older who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or military sexual trauma during their service or in their workplace. The objectives of the program are to: bring people together with shared experiences; support safer environments to give and receive peer support; help create meaningful connections and share in learning; reduce isolation and stigma; increase participant’s sense of empowerment; contribute to overall wellbeing. The Peer Support Program is being launched in a phased approach. We held consultations with people affected in the fall of 2021 to better understand their needs and wants. From the resulting What We Heard report , the Peer Support Program needed to offer a diverse array of peer support services. We also consulted subject matter experts who have experience in trauma care, military sexual trauma, sexual misconduct, mental health, peer support, and more. Program evaluations (such as anonymous online surveys and one-to-one discussions with a program staff) are in place to assess the service. Evaluation results are used to inform future developments of the program. The SMSRC also continues to host community consultations to further collect feedback. If you are interested in taking part in a service or to provide feedback, you can contact the Peer Support Program at SMSRCPSP-CSRISPSP@forces.gc.ca . Formal and Informal Peer Support Groups are currently available with additional services planned to launch in the coming year. The SMSRC will also provide regular updates on services as they become available via the SMSRC website and social media platforms. From a peer: “It was a wonderfully diverse group, at different stages in their healing, which made for incredible opportunities to learn from each other's experience. It was great having common ground. Knowing I'm not alone makes me feel stronger.” Meet the peer support team Peer Supporters are peers with lived experience of sexual misconduct and/or MST who are trained to support others through the delivery of our Peer Support Program services. They engage peer participants in discussion, model coping techniques and provide peer support by sharing aspects of their own healing process to foster connections, mutual exchange and break isolation. Mental Health Professionals are Social Workers or Social Service Workers who specialize in peer support, mental health, trauma care, and helping people affected by sexual misconduct, and MST. Their role is to co-facilitate the Formal Peer Support Group and provide emotional and crisis support during formal and informal group sessions, when needed.  The mental health professionals participate in an intensive facilitator training delivered by the Peer Support Program as well as professional development training required as part of their professional designation. Peer Support Regional Coordinators are members of the peer support team who conduct intakes with peer participants, coordinate peer support services and act as a main point of contact for the program.  They have an educational background in social services along with additional training in peer support, sexual misconduct and MST, trauma-informed approach to care, mental health and more. Training for Peer Supporters : All peer supporters and mental health professionals take part in the SMSRC orientation training. This training includes but is not limited to the fundamentals of peer support, active listening, a trauma informed approach to care, what is gender-based violence, intersecting forms of oppression and harm, impacts of trauma, crisis management, self-care, leading group discussions, and much more. The diverse and specific needs of CAF members, Veterans/former CAF members, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets, and Junior Canadian Rangers, are included, from various sources. Through scenario based-discussions, role-plays, and practice sessions, peer supporters are equipped with the necessary knowledge, tools, and assistance to provide peer services to affected community members. The orientation training was created with the help of subject matter experts and input from peers with lived experiences. The mental health professionals assist with the delivery of the orientation training and provide continued education to increase knowledge and skills of peer supporters throughout the year. Get involved If you are a CAF member, former CAF member/Veteran, current or former DND public service employee Cadet, Junior Canadian Ranger affected by sexual misconduct and/or MST 18 years and older and are interested in trying out the Peer Support Program services, please send us email at: SMSRCPSP-CSRISPSP@forces.gc.ca .

We have analyzed the consultation data and identified the following key themes and recommendations. Peer Support Program consultations Participant feedback at a glance Consultations were held in order to create a Peer Support Program that is representative of the needs of current and former CAF members who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or MST. While the engagement process began with 55 participants who initially volunteered, 26 were not in a place to participate due to their trauma or timing. Co-facilitation Situational flexibility Views on the need for co-facilitators for group sessions were divided. Some indicated a need for mental health professionals to assist and others indicated preferring no professional support. Communication Broad communications efforts Many were not aware of available resources after their traumatic event and hope to prevent this from happening to others. Screening process Safe and inclusive intake process with thorough peer supporter screening Flexibility was viewed as essential and participants want the choice to engage in a process that best meets their needs. Program delivery Choice of format Interest in various formats included in-person and virtual engagements for one-to-one meetings and small group sessions. Safety Confidential, discreet, and independent from the chain of command and the CAF rank structure Importance of safety from further institutional harm and perpetrators that inflicted trauma was emphasized. Training and experience Peer supporters training in mental health, trauma, boundaries and ethics Many indicated they would prefer to speak to a peer supporter with lived experience. Demographics Respondents had the option of responding to all or some of the questions and in the format of their choice such as: a written submission, a one-to-one interview, or a small group format.

From regular forces to reserve forces and civilian employees, the Defence Team stretches from coast to coast to coast. Its membership represents the strength, skills and diversity of Canada, and brings the experience necessary to protect and support Canadians no matter what is asked of them. What we do DND and the CAF have complementary roles to play in: Providing advice and support to the Minister of National Defence Implementing Government decisions regarding the defence of Canadian interests at home and abroad. The CAF serves on the sea, on land, in the air, and in space and cyberspace with the Royal Canadian Navy , the Canadian Army , the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command . In 2024, Canada released its renewed defence policy, Our North, Strong and Free , which outlines Canada’s plan to ensure the CAF remains ready, resilient and relevant in the context of increasing global uncertainty. This means doing more to keep us strong at home, secure in North America and engaged in the world, under six themes including: Supporting our people by placing focus on recruitment, retention and personal management, as well as investments into the quality of life for military members in form of support for health, housing and childcare. For all that CAF members give up for Canadians they all deserve to feel safe and valued in their workplace, it is our priority progress culture change. Strengthening the foundations of our military to ensure CAF members have the tools they need to do their job effectively and keep them safe. This will include modernizing existing capabilities and acquiring new ones; building civilian capacity; reviewing and reforming defence procurement; accelerating digital transformation. Building an innovative industrial base by leveraging innovation and fostering relationships with industry partners to sustain existing equipment and accelerate production capacity in Canada. This will allow the CAF to make reliable and valuable contributions to our allies and partners, particularly in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, in support of a more stable, peaceful world. Defending Canada in the Arctic and northern regions, where the changing physical and geopolitical landscapes have created new threats and vulnerabilities. By upgrading our continental defences to better detect incoming threats we can remain ready to assist when Canadians face natural disasters and other emergencies or are in need of search and rescue support. Defending North America as an active partner with the United States to restore continental defence and deterrence in all domains: sea, land, air, space and cyber, and through a modernized NORAD. Advancing Canada’s global interests and values through continuing valuable Canadian Armed Forces contributions to global efforts to deter major power conflict, confront terrorism and insurgency, and address instability.

As the world continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, new threats such as changing climate, new challenges to global stability, and accelerating advances in technology are affecting the foundations of Canadian security and prosperity. Our North, Strong and Free is an investment in Canada and Canadians; in our security and sovereignty; in the brave members of our military; and in jobs across the country, in communities from coast to coast to coast. It is an investment in the advanced technology innovation economy that will define our future, and in a more robust defence industrial base that will supply our troops and support tens of thousands of highly skilled jobs. More broadly, it supports our interests and engagements in the global alliances and partnerships that enable Canadian security and prosperity. Securing our Arctic will keep North America safe, allow us to support our allies abroad, and contribute to deterring global conflict. By bringing relevant, robust capabilities to NATO's northern and western flanks, Canada will make valuable contributions to our partnerships in Europe and the Indo-Pacific in defence of our shared security and prosperity. Policy - HTML version Our North, Strong and Free [ PDF - 4.17 MB ] A Renewed Vision for Canada’s Defence Our North, Strong and Free sets out a renewed vision for the future of defence in Canada, focusing on building a Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) that continues to keep us strong at home, secure in North America, and engaged in the world. Canada in a Time of Global Uncertainty Canadian security and prosperity in the coming years will be affected by three key trends: a more open and accessible Arctic and northern region driven by climate change, increasing global instability, and rapid advances in technology. Our Vision for Defence Our renewed vision is focused on preparing the military to meet these accelerating challenges, prioritizing those that most directly impact Canadians and Canada. It reaffirms that our insurance against instability and geopolitical uncertainty is a ready, resilient and relevant CAF capable of defending Canada at home, ensuring security in North America, and contributing to an international order that is free and open, inclusive, stable, and governed by the rule of law. Strengthening the Foundation Canada is committed to building a stronger military that is equipped to deliver increased security for Canadians. Our investments will enable the military to adapt in a sustainable, responsible manner, guided by our evolving national security needs in a more dangerous world. The Right Capabilities for Canada The CAF’s mission is to defend Canada and advance the safety, security, and prosperity of Canadians when and wherever it is needed. Further investments in our military will enable the CAF to respond to a rapidly changing climate and its impact on Canada's Arctic, brazen challenges to global stability, and accelerating technological innovation. Conclusion The objectives and initiatives laid out in Our North, Strong and Free will help Canada meet the pivotal moment of changing and increasing threats and help maintain the security and prosperity that Canadians have long enjoyed, through a robust, world-class military and defence team that reflects the full diversity and talent that Canada has to offer.

On behalf of the people of Canada, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) , with the support of the Department of National Defence (DND) , stand ready to perform three key roles: Defend Canada – by delivering excellence at home; Defend North America – by being a strong and reliable partner with the United States in the defence of the continent; and Contribute to International Peace and Security – by projecting leadership abroad. For more information about the Defence Team, please visit \" About the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces \". Additional information concerning the Department's priorities and raison d'être can be found in the most recent Departmental Report on Plans and Priorities . Responsibilities The Defence mission is to defend Canada and Canadian interests and values while contributing to international peace and security. The Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence have complementary roles to play in providing advice and support to the Minister of National Defence and in implementing the decisions of the Government on the defence of Canada and of Canadian interests at home and abroad.

Record Number: DND MSP 015 Back to top Defence Services and Contributions to Government Program The Defence Services and Contributions to Government Program aims to support the delivery of Canadian Government safety and security initiatives and encourage recognition and pride in Canada and the Canadian military. This is accomplished through the provision of unique Defence services in support of other elements of Government or the Canadian public. To encourage and share pride and awareness of Canada's military heritage, contributions, and leadership, Defence provides unique services and opportunities for outreach, awareness, preservation and development. Defence unique services also include operations conducted to ensure or enhance the security, safety, stability and/or well-being of Canadians, or international populations in peril, in accordance with Canadian values and the interests of the Canadian Government, in situations where there may be a need to defend against armed threats but where this is not the primary focus. The operations are delivered through the employment of force elements to achieve a desired effect within specific contexts through execution of tasks according to understood concepts, doctrine and standards. The force elements delivered by Defence are organizational entities which are composed of members of the Canadian Armed Forces and in some cases personnel from the Department of National Defence. Force elements have different sizes and compositions according to the capabilities they must apply during an operation. Defence remains consistently ready to employ force elements under this Program however significant operations do not always occur every fiscal year. Disaster Relief and Humanitarian Operations Disaster Relief and Humanitarian Operations aim to assist populations in distress in order to establish, re-establish or enhance the human safety and well-being through the use of military operations. Results are achieved through this Program by the employment of force elements with the requisite capabilities to minimize suffering, assist in recovery operations, facilitate synergies with other responding bodies, and conduct related support functions during natural disaster events, non-combat evacuation events, humanitarian emergencies, and other perilous situations as directed by the Government of Canada. Operations in this Program are bound by a number of federal and provincial laws, regulations, orders-in-council, federal policies, and international agreements. Defence Services for Canadian Safety and Security Defence Services for Canadian Safety and Security seeks to support Canadian Safety and Security initiatives across Canada through the delivery of force elements with the requisite capabilities to conduct military operations. Results are achieved by responding to a wide variety of threats to the safety and security of Canadians as part of a larger government-wide effort or a focused intervention. Examples of responses include providing, support to major Canadian events, anti-terrorism and terrorism event response, Search and Rescue operations, operations performed in direct support of other Government Departments and Agencies, as well as, related partnership programs such as the National Search and Rescue Program Coordination and the Canadian Safety and Security Program. Significant operations may not occur in all subordinate program areas every fiscal year as Defence only performs support operations when tasked by the Government of Canada. Canadian Safety and Security Program Description: The Canadian Safety and Security Program (CSSP) is the public safety and security component of DRDC's S&T Program.

In Canada, SAR responsibilities are shared by all levels of government and supported by both the private sector and volunteers. Responsibility for Canada's National Search and Rescue Program (NSP) resides with Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada. DND/CAF's primary responsibility is to provide SAR support from the air. The CAF also coordinates Canada's national response for air and maritime SAR. This work is led by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) . In the conduct of SAR operations DND/CAF may collect and use personal information provided to the regional Joint Rescue Coordination Centre by NavCanada and/or by friends and family of the missing person. Personal information collected for SAR operations will vary on a case-by-case basis. To help locate a missing person, DND/CAF may also collect mobile device information from network service providers. This information is generally limited to a device's International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number. Using the IMSI number, a DND/CAF SAR operator can determine (and may collect and use) an individual's geo-location. In addition to the above, DND/CAF may collect and use other information obtained from various sources as concerning incidents that have occurred within Canada's SAR area of responsibility since 1983 (whether air, marine and ground search and rescue incidents, and medical evacuations and civil aid requests). This includes information and conclusions drawn from the investigation of incidents, and certain operational information relating to SAR incidents, as stored in DND/CAF's NSP Management Information System (NSP MIS). Class of Individuals: Information described in this bank applies to individuals who were the objects of a search and/or rescue and those who provide information in support of a SAR operation. It may also include information about individuals involved in a SAR incident. Purpose: Information described in this bank is used to help locate and rescue lost, injured, or otherwise distressed person, or to recover victims from a disaster. Information stored in the NSP MIS is used for reporting purposes, and for the management of the NSP. Consistent Uses: Information collected by DND/CAF in for SAR operations may be shared with approved SAR partners. This includes federal, provincial, and municipal government agencies, private sector partners, and SAR volunteers. Data contained in the NSP MIS may be linked to other databases such as the DOT vessel and the aircraft registration data banks for data analysis. Data is used for administrative and statistical purposes.

Results are delivered by assembling force elements from the fundamental elements of Defence capability (i.e ., military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and, in some cases, real property), and integrating them through various training and certification programs so that they have the requisite amount of readiness in order to fulfill predefined roles within the operations for which they are destined. The term readiness refers to the volume, endurance, responsiveness and capability attributes of force elements that are not employed. These attributes are used to determine the degree of risk that would be associated with assigning them to fulfill perspective role(s) within on-going or contingency operations. The force elements produced by the Defence Ready Force Elements Production Program are organized into portfolios according to the land, aerospace, and maritime environments in which they operate. There are also portfolios for force elements that operate jointly across these domains and force elements that provide common support functions. Across these portfolios, force elements are produced to meet readiness targets. These readiness targets ensure that production can be sustained over short- and medium-term time horizons and that the number of force elements available for employment in on-going and contingency operations is in accordance with acceptable levels of operational risk. Force Elements Readiness Sustainment Program The Force Elements Readiness Sustainment Program aims to sustain the readiness state of force elements that have been assigned to roles that require them to be ready for operations. The force elements produced by the Canadian Armed Forces are organized into portfolios according to the land, aerospace, and maritime environments in which they operate. There are also portfolios for force elements that operate jointly across these domains and force elements that provide common support functions. In each portfolio there are subsets of force elements that are in one of three states: assigned to roles that required them to be ready to respond to contingency operations; delivering Defence operations and services; or in a reduced state of readiness. This Program focuses on force elements in the first of these states. In some cases the existence of ready force elements can act as a deterrent against threats. Results are achieved through the provision of periodic training, exercises, validation activities, and related production services which ensure that force elements capabilities that have been assigned to roles in contingency operations do not degrade and that these force elements remain responsive to fulfill assigned roles when called upon. Defence Services and Contributions to Government Program. Force elements participating in this program may be returned to Force Elements Integration Training Program for short periods.

The force elements received by this Program are organized into portfolios according to the land, aerospace and maritime environments in which they operate. There are also portfolios for force elements that operate jointly across these domains and force elements that provide common support functions. Results are achieved through the execution of training events in which force elements within the same portfolio exercise together for the explicit purpose of enhancing interoperability. Results are also achieved through training events where the explicit focus is interoperability between force elements in different portfolios. These are considered joint training events. International (combined) training events focus on the interoperability of force elements produced in Canada with those of allied nations. After partaking in this Program, force elements typically attain new or improved abilities to deliver a broader range of military effects during a defence operation and therefore this Program enables them to enhance their state of readiness. If the level of readiness attained through this Program is sufficient, then individual force elements may be assigned to fulfill a contingency role or they may be employed to deliver Defence operations or Defence services already in progress. They may also be delivered back to the Defence Ready Force Element Production Program.

Record Number: DND MPO 295 Force Elements Production Program The Force Elements Production Program aims to produce individual force elements with the ability to operate effectively as a cohesive unit, as per their design specification. The force elements produced by the Canadian Armed Forces are organized into portfolios according to the land, aerospace and maritime environments in which they operate. There are also portfolios for force elements that operate jointly across these environments and force elements that provide common support functions. This Program delivers results by assembling force elements from the fundamental elements of Defence capability (i.e. , military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and, in some cases, real property) and integrating them through various training and certification programs. Within this Program individual force elements attain a certain degree of readiness. If a sufficient level of readiness is attained, then individual force elements may be assigned to fulfill a contingency role or they may be directly employed to deliver Defence operations or Defence services that are already in progress. However, this program does not necessarily provide individual force elements with the ability to operate effectively as part of a larger integrated formation. If the force elements produced by this Program require advanced levels of interoperability, then they may be assigned to take part in the Force Element Integration Training Program.

Record Number: DND ADO 180 Back to top Defence Capability Elements Production Program The Defence Capability Elements Production Program aims to sustain Defence by producing and maintaining portfolios of the fundamental Defence capability elements so that they are continuously available in the appropriate quantity, combination and condition to sustain the chain of programs delivered by Defence, from the Defence Capability Development and Research Program through to the Defence Ready Force Elements Production Program, which collectively give Defence the ability to conduct Defence Combat and Support Operations as well as deliver Defence Services and Contributions to Government. The primary elements of Defence capability are military personnel, materiel and information systems, information, and real property. A fundamental focus of the Defence Capability Elements Production Program is to provide an adequate and sustained supply of individual military personnel and materiel in the near-term and over long-term time horizons so that they can be integrated to produce force elements within the Defence Ready Force Element Production Program. Results are achieved through military personnel and organization; materiel; real property; or information systems. A lifecycle approach is used to manage each portfolio. The essential aspects of the lifecycle approach are sub-sub-programs that provide the principle lifecycle functions: introduction into service; maintenance, upgrade and supply; release from service; portfolio management; and overarching co-ordination and control. The character of activity that occurs within each of these primary functions depends on the portfolio of entities being produced and therefore the desegregation of the lifecycle functions into sub-sub-programs is unique to each portfolio. The authority for this program is derived from the National Defence Act . The Military Personnel and Organization Lifecycle Program seeks to enable the production of ready force elements and fulfill obligations of Defence Combat and Support Operations, Defence Services and Contributions to Government, and Defence Capability Development and Research through the provision of the military establishment, personnel, and personnel services. The Program also honours and recognizes the service and unique sacrifices of our military personnel, provides for a safe and secure workplace, and ensures the appropriate conduct of Defence military personnel. It ensures that personnel are available in the quantity, mix of occupations and with the requisite occupational skills that provides for an optimized military establishment that enables the readiness and employment of multi-purpose combat capable forces and other Defence services. The Program oversees the availability of Regular and Reserve Force personnel to fulfill the military establishment, and the delivery of services provided to the personnel, including recruitment services; transition and release services; professional development services, occupation training services; morale and well being services; health care services; compensation and benefits services, honours and recognition services, security, protection, justice and safety services, and the planning and governance of the Program.

Personal information collected by DER for the purpose of investigating and resolving a DVR complaint may include: Service Number (SN) or Personal Record Identifier (PRI), Rank, Surname, Given name(s), DOB (yyyy-mm-dd), Title, Unit (if applicable), Address (street, city, province or territory, country, postal code), Telephone (work and home), Preferred means of communication, Preferred language of communication, Email address, Name and rank of victim liaison officer (if applicable), Whether there are any ongoing legal or administrative proceedings related to this complaint, Complaint Information (including which right(s) are alleged to have been infringed or denied by an authority within the Military Justice System), Details of complaint, Remedy sought through the complaint, Signature and date of complaint. Class of Individuals Current and former employees of DND, and current and former members of the CAF. Purpose Personal information in relation to DVR complaints is collected pursuant to Part III, Division 1.1 of the National Defence Act. Subsection 71.22(1) of Division 1.1 provides that every victim has the right to file a complaint for an infringement or denial of any of their rights. To be able to file a complaint under the DVR, an individual must be a victim in the context of a service offence within the military justice system. A service offence is any offence under the National Defence Act , the Criminal Code, or any other Act of Parliament, committed by a person while subject to the Code of Service Discipline at DND/CAF. For a DVR complaint to be heard, a victim must file a complaint in writing with the DER. Complaints require that alleged victims or complainants provide limited personal information. The DER will use that information to register the complaint and, following a preliminary review of the matter, to triage the complaint for investigation. The delegated reviewing body will determine if the complaint is bona fide or not and render a decision on the merits of the complaint. Where a complaint is deemed to be well founded, the reviewing body will make a recommendation to remedy the noted DVR infringement and the DER will notify the victim of the results of its investigation and proposed recommendation in writing. Consistent Uses Personal information collected, used, and disclosed in support of the DVR complaint process is subject to the authorities set out in the DVR complaints mechanism under the National Defence Act . Those personal information handling practices are generally consistent with the practices and procedures for the receipt, handling, and processing of human rights and other complaints handled by the DER. In all such cases, the investigation of complaints is conducted in private. As with other complaints handled by the DER, general information about DVR complaints may be used for program planning and evaluation purposes, in aggregate or once de-identified. Retention and Disposal Standards Personal information collected for complaint investigation and resolution will be retained for a minimum of 2 years in accordance with the Privacy Act , and for up to 5 years following the exhaustion of all appeals (except with the complainant’s consent).

Le SNEFC exerce autorité et compétence sur les personnes assujetties au Code de discipline militaire, peu importe leur grade et leur statut, partout où les Forces canadiennes sont établies ou déployées dans le monde. Commandement et contrôle Le commandant du SNEFC relève directement du Grand prévôt des Forces canadiennes. Peu importe leurs circonstances et le service auquel ils appartiennent, les membres du SNEFC demeurent sous le commandement du Grand prévôt. Cette structure hiérarchique permet au SNEFC de mener des enquêtes approfondies de façon équitable et impartiale. Processus d’enquête Généralement, il incombe aux organisations de la Police militaire de faire appel aux services du SNEFC, mais les membres des FC et le personnel du MDN peuvent déposer des plaintes, ou communiquer directement avec les bureaux régionaux ou avec des membres du personnel du SNEFC. Dès que le SNEFC est mis au courant d'allégations d'infractions possibles d'ordre criminel ou militaire, l'organisation procède immédiatement à l'examen des renseignements pour déterminer s’il faut ou non mener une enquête. Une fois que l’intervention du SNEFC aura été justifiée, les enquêteurs du SNEFC interrogeront le plaignant et entameront le processus d’enquête. L’enquête vise à reconstituer le fil des événements, à déterminer si une infraction a été commise, à identifier l’auteur de celle‑ci et à réunir les éléments de preuve pour qu’ils soient présentés devant le tribunal. Comme toutes les autres unités des crimes graves de la police canadienne, le SNEFC analysera par la suite tous les renseignements recueillis, en consultant souvent un membre de la Direction du service d’avocats de la défense, qui est une organisation indépendante, pour déterminer si les éléments de preuve dont il dispose justifient le dépôt d’une accusation. Comment déposer une plainte Vous pouvez appeler directement le Service national des enquêtes des Forces canadiennes (SNEFC) pour signaler un crime, déposer une plainte ou parler à un membre du SNEFC. Les membres du SNEFC suivent une formation spécialisée dans le domaine des enquêtes sur les agressions sexuelles, la violence physique, les enquêtes sur les infractions commises contre les enfants et les soins adaptés aux traumatismes subis. Ils sont également en mesure de protéger et de soutenir les victimes d’infractions à caractère sexuel en identifiant, en enquêtant et en offrant un soutien aux services de police dans le cadre de toute poursuite intentée contre les personnes responsables des infractions sexuelles. Le SNEFC gère également son propre Programme d’aide aux victimes à l’appui des enquêtes.

Roles and responsibilities The role and duty of the Council are to provide empirically, clinically, and experientially informed advice and recommendations to the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC) on key issues related to DND/CAF sexual misconduct. To fulfill this role, the Council will review and advise on SMSRC efforts and activities to: provide expert advice and help inform initiatives related to sexual misconduct and improve programs, policies and practices encourage and enhance transparency enhance support services, care and advocacy for individuals impacted by sexual misconduct increase understanding and awareness of sexual misconduct in DND/CAF other issues or topics related to sexual misconduct The SMSRC will provide briefings and documentation to the Council in a timely manner thereby ensuring their meaningful input prior to the implementation or adoption of any regulations, guidelines, policies, programs, or resources for which the Council’s advice is sought. Scope The Council will serve in an advisory capacity only. The Council has no authority over the operations of the SMSRC. The Council will be asked to provide independent, impartial, third-party advice, collectively or individually, on issues pertaining to sexual misconduct. The Council will be asked to review, advise, and comment on specific proposals, plans, initiatives, and programs in relation to sexual misconduct. The Council may be requested to establish connections between the SMSRC with other agencies, subject matter experts, or practitioners who could be of assistance based on the review of specific SMSRC proposals, plans, initiatives, or programs related to sexual misconduct. Council representation The maximum number of Council positions is eight (8). Council positions are drawn through public expressions of interest relayed to the SMSRC. Positions are from private and public sector agencies or organizations outside of DND/CAF and will be selected based on their experience, knowledge, expertise, and ability to provide advice concerning initiatives and issues related to sexual misconduct. Council positions dedicated to individuals selected based on their expertise or experience in specific topics related to sexual misconduct will be approved by the COO on behalf of the Deputy Minister. The term is three (3) years, with the possibility of extension. However, for those joining as affected community members, the term is two (2) years to encourage more council participation. Based on the requirements of the Council, a Chair may be appointed to liaise with the SMSRC and facilitate the Council’s sessions. The Chair will serve in that position for a three-year term, with the possibility of extension. Alternatively, if there is no Chair, this function may be assumed by the SMSRC or Council advisors on a case-by-case basis. As specific areas of interest emerge, the COO may invite additional subject matter experts to join Council meetings as guests, without permanently occupying a Council position. The Council is required to disclose any potential conflict of interest to the appropriate authorities within DND prior to assuming their roles on the Council in order for DND to assess whether the actual or potential conflict may impair, or be seen to impair, the Council member’s ability to discharge his or her duties as an independent, impartial, third-party advisor. The Council agrees that they will not use information obtained during their participation on the Council for personal gain, to benefit any organization with which they are affiliated, or to assist other entities or persons in their dealings with the Government of Canada. The Council agrees to recuse themselves from any discussion in respect of which they may be perceived to be in a real or perceived conflict of interest. They further agree to inform DND of any new appointments, interests, or activities if issues arise over which a future conflict of interest could emerge. The Council is required to inform and seek approval from the COO before appearing publicly in their official role as a member of the EAC, to maintain transparency with SMSRC as they are serving as representatives of the DND/CAF. If a Council advisor can no longer fulfill their role, they must advise the COO and the SMSRC as soon as possible. Confidentiality and terms of involvement The Council must maintain the confidentiality of all information provided to them by, or on behalf of, the Government of Canada in connection with their duties on the Council. This includes information that is confidential or proprietary to third parties. The Council must not disclose any information concerning the Council without the written permission of the Government of Canada. The Council agrees to use any information provided to them by, or on behalf of, the Government of Canada only for the purpose of fulfilling the terms of reference of the Council. The Council acknowledges that all this information remains the property of the Government of Canada or the third party. The Council must deliver to the Government of Canada all such information, together with all copies, drafts, working papers and notes that contain such information, upon completion or termination of their participation on the Council, or upon request at such an earlier time as Canada may require. Individuals must agree to and sign a Volunteer Service Agreement, as well as adhere to its clauses. Individuals on council are expected to act in accordance with the Terms of Reference and the SMSRC Collaborative Engagement Principles as outlined in Annex A. Meetings The Council will meet at the request of the COO. Meetings will be held four to six times annually, with sessions lasting approximately two to three hours. Additionally, there is a requirement for at least one in-person meeting spanning two days. Attendance at these meetings is considered mandatory. Remote ad hoc meetings may be convened at the discretion of the COO; participation for ad hoc meetings may be voluntary, and attendance will be based on the subject matter expertise of council advisors. In person meetings will primarily be scheduled in the National Capital Region, but locations may vary if needed. The Council will be asked in advance to submit their preferred meeting dates through mechanisms provided by the SMSRC. The SMSRC will maintain a forward agenda of issues of interest identified by the Council and COO. The final selection of meeting agendas will be determined by the COO, in collaboration with the Executive Office, and in consultation with the Council when necessary. The SMSRC will circulate background materials to be considered at a Council meeting at least one week prior to the scheduled meeting. Reporting Advice from the Council is in the form of written and verbal recommendations. The Council is encouraged to reach consensus in providing advice whenever possible. When consensus is not possible, the record of discussion will reflect the different opinions and the number of Council individuals supporting each opinion. A record of discussion and recommendations will be completed within four weeks of each meeting and will be sent to the Council for review. The records of discussion may also be used to form the basis for any reports requested by the Deputy Minister. The COO and SMSRC will take the Council’s advice into consideration in developing guidance and recommendations to the CAF to help inform initiatives and items related to sexual misconduct. Updates on the outcomes and effects of the Council’s recommendations will be provided to the Council when applicable. Meeting agendas, records of discussion, council recommendations as well as their outcomes and effects may be made accessible to the public upon request and could also be published online. In addition to advice in the form of consensus recommendations, the COO may seek input from the Council secretarially on new or existing SMSRC programs or initiatives. In such cases, the Council may provide input individually to be collated and considered by the relevant authority or program leads. Where possible, the SMSRC will inform the EAC of the impact of their input. Expenses The Council will be reimbursed for standard expenses incurred in relation to the execution of their duties in support of the Council during in-person meetings. Standard expenses include meals, travel, and accommodation in accordance with the National Joint Council Travel Directive. Language of communication Council participants, including SMSRC staff and EAC members are invited to communicate with each other in the official language of their choice. Update of the terms of reference The EAC terms of reference will be reviewed every three years, or earlier as necessary. Resources Administrative support required for the Council will be provided through the SMSRC.

Mandate Provide supportive and facilitated restorative opportunities for Canadian Armed Forces and National Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Members to be heard and acknowledged, and for Defence Representatives to learn, understand, plan, act and lead as catalysts for change supporting the Institution to end sexual misconduct. Program development and implementation A dedicated RE Program team within the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC) designed and developed the program in collaboration with: subject matter experts in restorative approaches, trauma, sexual misconduct, military norms, culture and conflict resolution; stakeholders including individuals who experienced sexual misconduct in the Defence workplace. We began by consulting with the community we serve, on what they needed in a restorative engagement program. We officially launched the RE Program in its initial operating capability (IOC) on November 15 , 2021. The program contacted a small group of class members to participate. In January 2022, the first groups of Defence representatives began working in cohorts with restorative practitioners to develop the knowledge and skills needed to engage with class members and translate what they learned into meaningful action for culture change. The program has continued to bring together Defence representatives to meet the CMs needs for engagements and to learn from them, and the activities are expected to continue into 2026. Program team The RE Program team is composed of the following: Director of RE : reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer of the SMSRC Deputy Director: responsible for integrated human resources, business and financial planning, research, program support, evaluation, and strategic support to the RE Director. Managers of Operations (three) : responsible for implementing the program by region (East, Central, West/North) Restorative practitioners : responsible for facilitating participation of Defence representatives and class members in the program.

Principles of a restorative approach Focused on relations Puts people and their relationships to one another, between groups and with institutions, at the centre. A restorative approach places the emphasis on addressing harm and establishing or re-establishing justice and trust in relationships. This is done by mutual dignity, respect, care and concern. Comprehensive and holistic Works in integrated ways and looks for the connections between issues, causes, circumstances, and culture. Inclusive and participatory Including and empowering those with lived experience, being open and transparent with them about options and limitations, honouring choices for how they would like to participate, and removing barriers to access. Responsive Being flexible and adaptable in all of our work so as to be responsive to participants’ needs, objectives, and circumstances and the context within which the program exists.

Fall 2024 Summer 2024 Spring 2024 Fall 2023 Summer 2023 March 2023 June 2022 March 2022 Defence representatives The Restorative Engagement Program is actively seeking Defence representatives to join the 2025 cohorts. We invite all CAF members and DND public service employees who are interested in playing a role in this culture change process within our institution to submit a nomination (only available on the National Defence Network). Defence representatives are CAF members and DND public service employees. Their work in the program is to first acknowledge and learn from the experiences and insights of those who have been harmed by sexual misconduct. Then, they plan and prepare to take meaningful action to contribute to culture change. Defence representatives commit to: listening with an open mind and considering multiple and conflicting perspectives participating actively in reflective learning activities learning to engage restoratively and without causing harm carrying what they learn forward into their career within the institution contributing to preventing sexual misconduct in the Defence Team and culture change beyond their time in this program Defence representatives participate in groups of 6 to 8 CAF members and DND public service employees of diverse professions, backgrounds, and identify factors. There are new flexible ways they can participate in the program. We call these groups cohorts. All following options were designed with awareness of the range of influence those ranks/levels have in contribution to culture change. Option 1 and 2 For Defence Team members of  any rank/level Designed for Defence representatives to learn skills to contribute to culture change in their own contexts across the whole institution Individual and group engagements Option 3: For senior leaders Designed for Defence representatives to learn skills to support culture change efforts by those they directly supervise Individual and possible group engagements Option 4: For executives Designed for Defence representatives to learn skills to support culture change efforts of those they supervise and at the institutional level Limited number of group engagements DR alumni community For alumni DRs Designed as an opportunity for alumni DRs to participate in engagements after their completion of one of the options Individual and group engagement Cohort work is facilitated by restorative practitioners. Defence representatives are essential agents of culture change that class members expect will occur through RE. To this end, Defence representative participation in the program has been carefully designed, using a restorative approach, to maximize Defence representative learning, planning and action, in real time. Defence representatives may engage with class members. Engagement sessions are one of several ways of learning in this program about sexual misconduct; they will have many opportunities to learn from class members’ experiences throughout the program (readings, videos, CM submissions, etc.). The Defence leadership’s role Members of the CAF chain of command and DND executives and management support implementation of the program by: promoting the recruitment of Defence representatives encouraging potential Defence representatives to take part by nominating them and by self-nominating to join a cohort providing Defence representatives with a confidential workplace and equipment ensuring that Defence representatives are not tasked with other duties during their participation in the full time portions of the program engaging with Defence representatives about what they’ve learned through the program, how they plan to take that forward in their career and into their workplace, and what they need from leadership to support their efforts in culture change supporting Defence representatives in carrying forward their action plan Restorative practitioners Restorative practitioners are DND public service employees. They are independent from the CAF chain of command. It is important to note that the role of restorative practitioners is to facilitate restorative processes/principles, assisting CMs and DRs in participating in the program and offering referrals to support services and resources, as needed.

On this page About the Restorative Engagement Program Class members Defence representatives Restorative practitioners Support services and resources Information sessions Send us your feedback Contact Us About the Restorative Engagement Program The Restorative Engagement (RE) Program was mandated through the Canadian Armed Forces-Department of National Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Final Settlement . Mandate Provide supportive and facilitated restorative opportunities for Canadian Armed Forces and National Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Members to be heard and acknowledged, and for Defence Representatives to learn, understand, plan, act and lead as catalysts for change supporting the Institution to end sexual misconduct. Program development and implementation A dedicated RE Program team within the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC) designed and developed the program in collaboration with: subject matter experts in restorative approaches, trauma, sexual misconduct, military norms, culture and conflict resolution; stakeholders including individuals who experienced sexual misconduct in the Defence workplace. We began by consulting with the community we serve, on what they needed in a restorative engagement program. We officially launched the RE Program in its initial operating capability (IOC) on November 15 , 2021. The program contacted a small group of class members to participate. In January 2022, the first groups of Defence representatives began working in cohorts with restorative practitioners to develop the knowledge and skills needed to engage with class members and translate what they learned into meaningful action for culture change. The program has continued to bring together Defence representatives to meet the CMs needs for engagements and to learn from them, and the activities are expected to continue into 2026. Program team The RE Program team is composed of the following: Director of RE : reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer of the SMSRC Deputy Director: responsible for integrated human resources, business and financial planning, research, program support, evaluation, and strategic support to the RE Director. Managers of Operations (three) : responsible for implementing the program by region (East, Central, West/North) Restorative practitioners : responsible for facilitating participation of Defence representatives and class members in the program.

Principles of a restorative approach Focused on relations Puts people and their relationships to one another, between groups and with institutions, at the centre. A restorative approach places the emphasis on addressing harm and establishing or re-establishing justice and trust in relationships. This is done by mutual dignity, respect, care and concern. Comprehensive and holistic Works in integrated ways and looks for the connections between issues, causes, circumstances, and culture. Inclusive and participatory Including and empowering those with lived experience, being open and transparent with them about options and limitations, honouring choices for how they would like to participate, and removing barriers to access. Responsive Being flexible and adaptable in all of our work so as to be responsive to participants’ needs, objectives, and circumstances and the context within which the program exists. Focused on individual and collective responsibility Pays attention to the ways in which the system affects individuals and the ways in which individuals affect the system. Defence representatives take responsibility for change in their daily roles and work with each other and the institution to address structural factors that contribute to harm.

Information Sessions How to Reach Out Dear class member, This message is being sent to you as someone who expressed interest in receiving information regarding the Restorative Engagement (RE) Program on their claim form for the CAF-DND Sexual Misconduct Class Action Settlement. The following will provide you with a few updates on the activities occurring within the RE program. Progress in the Program Since the launch of the program two years ago, we have had meaningful and restorative conversations. Class members' feedback on how to improve the program has been crucial. Many said that the wait time to be contacted was too long. We acknowledge that and to allow us to contact a greater number of class members, we recently hired intake officers across the country. To date, we have contacted more than 1,500 class members who have submitted their claim and shown an interest in RE. Before the end of the calendar year, intake officers will be connecting with you to confirm your interest in the program. We encourage you to monitor your inbox or mailbox and reply to our message as soon as you can so that we can ensure your participation is expedited. Defence representatives' contribution is key to the success of the program to provide class members the opportunity to engage with them directly or indirectly. To date, 11 cohorts , which are small groups of up to eight Defence representatives have completed their participation in the RE program. We are currently facilitating three cohorts and are planning another five in January 2024 .These representatives are Defence Team members who volunteered to acknowledge and learn from your experiences and insights and contribute to culture change in a meaningful and tangible way. We are grateful for everyone's input, and we continue to work on adjusting the program to reflect what we have learned so far. We will continue to update you in our progress. Did You Know? Defence representatives participate in the program in small groups called cohorts. Restorative practitioners are assigned to facilitate their participation. The three phases of the cohort process are: Phase 1: Learning and Connecting Defence representatives: Build knowledge on the issue of sexual misconduct, the culture that contributes to it, and restorative approaches. Develop skills to support their roles in the program and prepare to engage with class members. Consider their role and responsibility in addressing the problem of sexual misconduct. Phase 2: Listening, Learning and Understanding Defence representatives: Continue to learn about the contexts, causes and impacts of sexual misconduct, and what needs to change to end it (including learning through engagement sessions with class members). Develop restorative leadership skills by facilitating parts of the cohort. Begin developing leadership plans for how they will take the knowledge and skills they have gained back to their roles in the institution. Phase 3: Preparing, Planning and Acting Defence representatives: Deepen their understanding of what needs to change at the individual, collective and institutional levels to end sexual misconduct. Plan and prepare strategies and actions to contribute to culture change as they return to their regular duties. Choose an issue/idea and will learn more about it, so that they can apply what they learn to act in support of change. Explore issues, ideas, strategies, and commitments for how to make a difference through leadership (their own and others). Generate a summary of these learnings to contribute to institutional learning, planning and action.
