These include Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members, Veterans/former CAF members, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets and Junior Canadian Rangers, 18 years and older. On this page Definition Creating a Peer Support Program Meet the peer support team Get involved Definition Peer support is the giving and receiving of emotional support among people who share a common experience. It offers a safer space where peers affected are believed and their experiences validated. It also promotes a sense of: belonging; encouragement; solidarity; healing; empowerment and resilience. Creating a Peer Support Program People affected by sexual misconduct and MST report that the specific DND/CAF aspects of their experiences are not always well understood by external civilian practitioners or service providers. They often describe feelings of isolation when seeking support services. Many people who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or MST through their service or in their place of work and those who work to support them, have requested the development of a Peer Support Program as outlined in the External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces report (the Deschamps Report) published in 2015. This program supports CAF members, former CAF members/Veterans, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets, Junior Canadian Rangers, 18 years and older who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or military sexual trauma during their service or in their workplace. The objectives of the program are to: bring people together with shared experiences; support safer environments to give and receive peer support; help create meaningful connections and share in learning; reduce isolation and stigma; increase participant’s sense of empowerment; contribute to overall wellbeing. The Peer Support Program is being launched in a phased approach. We held consultations with people affected in the fall of 2021 to better understand their needs and wants. From the resulting What We Heard report , the Peer Support Program needed to offer a diverse array of peer support services. We also consulted subject matter experts who have experience in trauma care, military sexual trauma, sexual misconduct, mental health, peer support, and more. Program evaluations (such as anonymous online surveys and one-to-one discussions with a program staff) are in place to assess the service. Evaluation results are used to inform future developments of the program. The SMSRC also continues to host community consultations to further collect feedback. If you are interested in taking part in a service or to provide feedback, you can contact the Peer Support Program at SMSRCPSP-CSRISPSP@forces.gc.ca . Formal and Informal Peer Support Groups are currently available with additional services planned to launch in the coming year. The SMSRC will also provide regular updates on services as they become available via the SMSRC website and social media platforms. From a peer: “It was a wonderfully diverse group, at different stages in their healing, which made for incredible opportunities to learn from each other's experience. It was great having common ground. Knowing I'm not alone makes me feel stronger.” Meet the peer support team Peer Supporters are peers with lived experience of sexual misconduct and/or MST who are trained to support others through the delivery of our Peer Support Program services. They engage peer participants in discussion, model coping techniques and provide peer support by sharing aspects of their own healing process to foster connections, mutual exchange and break isolation. Mental Health Professionals are Social Workers or Social Service Workers who specialize in peer support, mental health, trauma care, and helping people affected by sexual misconduct, and MST. Their role is to co-facilitate the Formal Peer Support Group and provide emotional and crisis support during formal and informal group sessions, when needed.  The mental health professionals participate in an intensive facilitator training delivered by the Peer Support Program as well as professional development training required as part of their professional designation. Peer Support Regional Coordinators are members of the peer support team who conduct intakes with peer participants, coordinate peer support services and act as a main point of contact for the program.  They have an educational background in social services along with additional training in peer support, sexual misconduct and MST, trauma-informed approach to care, mental health and more. Training for Peer Supporters : All peer supporters and mental health professionals take part in the SMSRC orientation training. This training includes but is not limited to the fundamentals of peer support, active listening, a trauma informed approach to care, what is gender-based violence, intersecting forms of oppression and harm, impacts of trauma, crisis management, self-care, leading group discussions, and much more. The diverse and specific needs of CAF members, Veterans/former CAF members, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets, and Junior Canadian Rangers, are included, from various sources. Through scenario based-discussions, role-plays, and practice sessions, peer supporters are equipped with the necessary knowledge, tools, and assistance to provide peer services to affected community members. The orientation training was created with the help of subject matter experts and input from peers with lived experiences. The mental health professionals assist with the delivery of the orientation training and provide continued education to increase knowledge and skills of peer supporters throughout the year. Get involved If you are a CAF member, former CAF member/Veteran, current or former DND public service employee Cadet, Junior Canadian Ranger affected by sexual misconduct and/or MST 18 years and older and are interested in trying out the Peer Support Program services, please send us email at: SMSRCPSP-CSRISPSP@forces.gc.ca .

In response to this reality, there is an increasing need to establish more comprehensive support services for those affected by military sexual trauma (MST) Footnote 2 . As such, a peer support program focused on the needs of current and former CAF members is being developed to add to the range of available resources. Consultations with members of the MST community were held from October 11 to November 12, 2021. The information gathered from these consultations is intended to guide the development and design of the MST Peer Support Program, while acknowledging it may not be possible to act on all information shared during the consultations. This report summarizes the views and ideas shared by the members of the MST community who participated in the consultations. What We Heard There is a strong desire for individualized victim-centered programming, with a focus on the provision of multiple program format options and flexibility to move between different types of support. Additionally, effective matching of peer-to-peer supporter, group matching and safe, non-judgmental, supportive and confidential programming is paramount. Programming should be accessible in multiple locations in and out of military facilities. Peer supporters should be knowledgeable, mentally fit, compassionate, empathetic, accepting of others, considered an equal, and have an understanding of the military environment. Peer supporters should also be trauma-informed, receive peer support training, with support and access to professional guidance. A number of potential barriers to accessing MST Peer Support programing were identified throughout the consultations, including: geographical challenges, involvement of the military chain of command, as well as, stigma, shame and guilt. Many participants suggested a need for broad program communication and careful consideration of program branding. It was also suggested that the program should be promoted by CAF leadership, both early in military careers and at transition phases. Finally, participants identified a need within the CAF to foster sexual misconduct prevention, focused on promoting open dialogue, reducing silence, fear, shame, and stigma. Next Steps Following this report, the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre (SMRC) and Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) will use the information collected during the consultation process to develop the MST Peer Support model. The model will continue to be reviewed and tested by the Peer Support Consultation Working Group and Subject Matter Experts Advisory Group with the end goal of launching the Peer Support Program in summer 2022. Background As noted by Adam Cotter in the Statistics Canada report on Sexual Misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces Regular Force, 2018 , sexual misconduct includes a broad spectrum of behaviours ranging from inappropriate or unwanted jokes or comments to sexual assault, tends to impact women more than men and is a problem faced by many organizations. More recently, greater attention and awareness of these behaviours have been brought to light by global movements such as #MeToo. As a result, there have been increased discussions around how best to prevent these behaviours and support those who have been victimized or affected – both inside and outside the workplace. Based on results from the 2016 and 2018 Survey on Sexual Misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces conducted by Statistics Canada, reported rates of sexual misconduct have remained consistent. In 2018, approximately 900 Regular Forces members and 600 Primary Reservist members experienced sexual misconduct in the 12 months preceding the survey’s administration. This was not statistically different from 2016, when the survey was conducted for the first time. In 2018, the proportion of women in the Regular Force who reported being sexually assaulted (4.3% of the population) was approximately four times higher than that of men (1.1%). Similar results were found in 2016. The prevalence of sexual assault was almost six times higher for women in the Primary Reserve in 2018 (7.0%) than for men in the Reserves (1.2%) Footnote 3 Footnote 4 . Specialized peer support is one of the highest priority interventions most frequently requested by survivors of sexual misconduct during military service. The recognition and request for peer support programming for current and former CAF members who have experienced sexual misconduct during military service has come from various sources and has been persistent over time. Since the publication of the External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces report in 2015, members of It’s Not Just 20K (previously known as It’s Not Just 700 (INJ700)) have been asking for MST peer support programming. In 2016, peer support was identified in the victim needs analysis completed by the Canadian Armed Forces Strategic Response Team-Sexual Misconduct (CSRT-SM), and it is a recommendation in the Survivor Support Strategy, a document developed in support of Schedule N of the Heyder-Beattie Final Settlement Agreement . In August 2020, the SMRC and VAC submitted a joint proposal for the inclusion of a peer support program in the National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence led by Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE). In response to the increasing need to establish more comprehensive support services for those affected by military sexual trauma, the Government of Canada initiated the process of developing a MST peer support program. The objective of the MST Peer Support Program is to provide equitable and sustainable access to online and face-to-face peer support to current and former CAF members who experienced sexual misconduct during their service. The MST Peer Support Program will fill a critical gap by providing emotional and social support to affected individuals while increasing awareness about available resources and services and increasing participants’ sense of empowerment and self-efficacy, thereby decreasing their isolation, stigma and shame, and contributing to their overall well-being and recovery. The MST Peer Support Program will expand upon existing supports available to CAF members and Veterans who experienced sexual misconduct during their service. The program will be jointly developed and delivered by DND and VAC and operationalized through the SMRC. A Human-Centered Design Footnote 5 philosophy focused on the needs of the MST community and which recognizes and respects the moral injury sustained by individuals impacted by MST will reinforce the service model. In keeping with the Human-Centered Design philosophy, the SMRC and VAC engaged with CAF members and Veterans who experienced sexual misconduct during their service to gain feedback and insight on what the MST Peer Support Program should include. Engagement process Consultations were conducted through semi-structured individual and group online interviews led by members of the MST Peer Support Consultation Working Group Footnote 6 , the Subject Matter Expert (SME) MST Peer Support Advisory Group Footnote 7 , as well as members of the SMRC, who also ensured appropriate documentation was captured. The engagement process was guided by nine open ended questions ( Appendix A ) focused on key program development features, including: peer support program model program accessibility potential barriers to accessing peer support services peer supporter characteristics In an effort to reach a diverse and wide-range of participants, the SMRC sent invitations to broad group of affected persons via its established networks and contacts. Initially, 55 people expressed an interest in participating in the peer support consultations. However, in the end, formal consultations were completed with 29 of the 55 participants who initially expressed interest. There are a number of reasons for this decrease in participation. For some individuals, timing was a key consideration, while others felt they were no longer in a position to participate due to their trauma experience and/or previous harm, and the potential for the interviews to be triggering and some did not respond to the invitation to participate. The nine interview questions were provided to participants in advance of the consultations, and participants had the option of providing written responses only or submitting written responses and proceeding with either a one-on-one interview or a small group interview. Three written submissions, 25 individual interviews and one group interview took place from October 11 to November 12, 2021. During the interviews, responses from the participants were documented by note takers. At the end of the engagement process, an iterative coding approach was used to summarize participant responses shared in the written responses and notes taken during the interviews. Each response was reviewed line-by-line and systematically assigned a descriptive code. The detailed codes were reviewed and grouped into higher-level categories to summarize responses by topic. This process continued until the data were organized into meaningful groups and sub-groups allowing for a detailed summary of all participants’ contributions. When interpreting the data, it is important to note the variation in level of detail in the notes taken during the interviews, and the frequency of similar feedback and insight shared by the participants. As a result, this report uses the descriptors ‘most’, ‘many’, ‘some’ and ‘few’ to describe the frequency which participants shared a common perspective ( Appendix B ). Participants were also invited to complete a non-mandatory demographic survey in advance of the interview sessions. A breakdown of the demographic data can be found in the demographic tables located in Appendix C . What we heard Benefits of peer support Participants shared several thoughts around the benefits of a peer support program for their healing and recovery, including: access to support, help, and assistance validation, understanding, or reducing feelings of isolation opportunity to learn new skills (for example, coping strategies, resilience) and/or learn from another’s own experiences mutual support between peers (for example, peers helping peers) rather than a one-sided support relationship opportunity to engage in recreational activities (for example, hikes, painting) or to build social connections with those who have gone through similar experiences; help with navigating systems or accessing resources building a community or support network help with their healing process Program format Participants shared a number of perspectives related to the format/model of peer support (for example, in-person versus online; group versus one-on-one). For example: The majority of participants expressed that the format of peer support should be based on the unique, individual needs of program participants. Safety is considered a high priority in the setting of a peer support program. Program participants need to feel that they are in a “safe space” (regardless of their physical location) and can talk openly with their peers. A number of participants also described the setting as needing to be inviting and welcoming. This included adjectives such as comfortable, relaxed, non-judgemental, feeling at ease, warm, and supportive. The ability to switch between peer support formats or use multiple formats based on individual circumstances. For instance, there may be days where individuals cannot attend in-person sessions for various reasons (for example, health, winter weather) and therefore should be able to access peer support virtually. Moreover, participants’ preferences or needs could evolve over time (for example, in-person versus group setting), so the program should be responsive to changing needs. Program flexibility to accommodate evolving needs. For example: In-person, one-on-one support, transitioning to a smaller group, followed by larger group (relying on online setting as a back-up option) Starting in a group setting then splitting off into one-on-one with a self-selected peer supporter Starting with small groups then expanding to larger groups In-person to begin, with online maintenance a possibility once relationships are established Smaller groups nested within a large group, with small groups rotating regularly to provide participants with the opportunity to meet new people Diversity and choice in the type of support (for example, religious-based versus experience-based support) or activities (for example, variety in social and learning activities) available Some participants indicated that groups should include at least one facilitator who can support as needed. This individual was often described as someone with clinical experience or mental health-related knowledge given that program participants are connecting over traumatic experiences. Some participants also indicated that the facilitators should be gender diverse, aware of gender considerations, and understand trauma and the military environment. Some participants emphasized that the program needs to offer flexible scheduling to ensure accessibility, with availability both during and outside working hours. Further, some indicated that they would like the program to be accessible 24/7 to ensure that support is available when it is needed. However, this need can likely be addressed by the SMRC’s existing 24/7 line. A few participants indicated that a psychologist should be available, as well as someone to moderate group discussions. It was suggested that there should also be support available for family members. In addition to the aforementioned comments on the model more generally, participants also expressed a number of thoughts relating to specific models of peer support: One-on-one support The utility of one-on-one meetings as a trust building mechanism for individuals who are not yet comfortable in a group forum. Opportunities to engage in informal conversation with peers as opposed to educational or skill-building activities. The potential for one-on-one meetings to be problematic if boundaries and expectations are not established and maintained. Some participants explicitly indicated that they would prefer one-on-one to group settings. Group support The importance of anonymity and confidentiality in group settings. Group size is also an important consideration with most individuals stating a preference for small groups of 5-8 people. Some individuals also pointed out that larger drop-in groups could be an option to ensure the program is accessible and inclusive to all. The importance of established structure for group meetings. Online support Many participants indicated that they could see the value in accessing peer supports online. Many indicated that they perceived the online environment as being a safe and comfortable for individuals who may be hesitant to access peer support due to feelings of shame, fear of reprisal, and/or concerns with lack of privacy or anonymity. Online support may be more easily accessible to those who live in rural or remote regions, or are on deployment. Online meetings can establish cross-country connections between those who have experienced MST. However, some participants expressed concerns including: The potential difficulty in establishing meaningful relationships online (for example, video would be needed to connect and understand emotion); Some individuals may not be comfortable being on camera; and, Moderators would be needed to manage online forums. In-person support May be easier to connect with others or build trust in-person than online. Confidentiality remains an important consideration when meeting in person. Telephone support Some participants mentioned that telephone options may need to be considered for privacy reasons, to enable access for individuals on deployment, or to conduct intake interviews. Accessibility and Eligibility Many participants discussed considerations around determining eligibility to participate in the program. Recommendations included: Vetting/screening peer supporters, facilitators, or coordinators prior to their involvement in the program to ensure participant safety. The referral and/or client access to MST Peer Support services must be easy to navigate and comfortable for perspective clients (for example, multiple access points or referral options, ensuring that there are non-military access points built into the program, paperwork should be simple/easy to complete). Overall wellness should be considered prior to entering the peer support program. Intake interviews be conducted to screen and match peers, assess individual needs, or assess readiness. It should be made clear to potential participants that their experiences of MST will not be questioned upon accessing the program or that they do not need to demonstrate that they have experienced MST to participate in the program. The program should be accessible to all who have experienced MST, regardless of the nature of the MST experienced. Physical location considerations Recommendations were also provided regarding the physical location for in-person meetings. For example: Many participants indicated that physical meeting locations should not be on CAF bases or in facilities associated with the military. Safety and comfort should be key considerations. For example, the meeting location should not be disclosed to individuals outside of the group, it should be a mutually agreed upon location, and physical layout considerations (for example, exits should be easily accessible). It was also pointed out that individuals who live in small towns may not be comfortable with certain public spaces such as the local community centre. Consideration should be given to participants with children or support persons; and, Some suggested that Military Family Resource Centres would be a good option for in-person peer support, as they are safe places, off-base, and accessible for those with child care needs. Boundaries and expectations around behaviour Some participants indicated that boundaries would need to be agreed upon by those participating in the program, in terms of support obligations and/or the nature of the relationship between peer supporters and those being supported (for example, the need to maintain professional boundaries). Some participants also indicated that expectations or guidelines around individuals’ behaviour should be agreed upon at the outset of the program/sessions to ensure that individuals are mindful and respectful of one another, and to have a protocol in place for resolving group conflict. Some individuals also suggested that standards of practice should be developed in order to create a safe space for participants. Group development and peer-to-peer matching considerations A number of recommendations and considerations were shared by the participants concerning how groups should be developed or how peers should be matched at the individual peer level. Many participants expressed that peer fit, or allowing the choice of peer or group based on certain characteristics, was an important consideration. This could include such characteristics as gender, sexual orientation, as well as victimization phase (in other words, newly victimized individuals who have never received support before versus those whose victimization took place well in the past and have received support). Some participants indicated that individuals should be able to select their group or peer based on gender preference. Some suggested that groups should be separated by gender or that peers should be matched based on gender. In contrast, a few indicated that these delineations should not take place. A few participants discussed the need to consider preferences and options based on an individual’s sexual orientation (in other words, having groups specifically for LGBTQ2+ individuals); and. One participant emphasized that the options available need to be inclusive and mindful of non-binary individuals (for example, having an option for open, drop-in groups that do not require individuals to self-select into a gender-specific group). Desired qualities of peer supporters Participants identified a wide variety of desired attributes of peer supporters, including those related to personal experience, knowledge, skills, abilities, and traits. Some of the more commonly identified qualities included: similar lived experience empathy knowledge of and/or experience within the military environment active or strong listening skills compassion integrity, including honesty, authenticity, and transparency non-judgemental self-aware and/or able to self-regulate mentally fit or at a stage in their recovery where they have the capacity to support others accepting of differences and inclusive of others up-to-date knowledge on relevant supportive resources motivated, committed, and passionate an equal (in other words, peer), not a superior or a professional knowledge of trauma-informed care Training and oversight Many participants indicated that training should be provided to individuals involved in the peer support program, although the range of training domains varied. Some participants indicated supporters, coordinators, and/or facilitators should be provided with mental health-related training and/or training related to trauma-informed care; however, some were agnostic on the need for mental health-related training. Training relating to boundaries, the legal limits of confidentiality, intersectionality, non-judgemental behaviour, active listening, and how to guide/support individuals based on their needs were seen as beneficial. Some participants discussed professional oversight of the program or the need for supporter or facilitator supervision and support. For instance: Some participants suggested that supporters or facilitators should have regular contact with a professional who can provide them with advice on managing challenging situations while also ensuring that they remain in a position to provide support to others. Other recommendations included: an oversight board with professional training that is representative of the CAF and diverse identities (for example, based on language, sexual orientation, gender identity, race); oversight should include multi-disciplinary professionals with expertise in sexual trauma; however, the voice of those who have experienced MST should be prioritized; and, oversight provided by civilians, independent of the CAF, including CAF healthcare professionals. Additional comments relating to training included: media training for participants of the peer support program peer support training for all military personnel, particularly leaders Potential barriers to access Participants identified a number of often interrelated barriers that may prevent them, or others who have experienced MST, from seeking support or accessing the program. Some of the most frequently shared barriers included: accessibility-related barriers including geographical inaccessibility (for example, due to deployment or living in a small, rural, or remote community, lack of transportation support); lack of physically accessible locations or activities for people with disabilities; lack of child care options to enable participation regardless of family status; and, lack of scheduling options/flexibility to accommodate work or family obligations involvement of the military chain of command or association with the military environment. For example, military control over the program, program accessibility through referrals by the Chain of Command or CAF mental health providers, and/or if military-associated facilities were used to host sessions/meetings concerns about lack of confidentiality, anonymity, and/or privacy. A number of participants expressed that some individuals with MST may be concerned with their participation in the program becoming known to others (for example, colleagues, the Chain of Command) feelings of shame, guilt, or stigma surrounding MST fear of exclusion, rejection, or judgement by others inability to select/choose or find a supporter/facilitator who is a good fit with an individual’s preferences and needs lack of confidence in the program. For instance, concerns about investing oneself into the program, only to have a negative experience or outcome fear of reprisal by the CAF institution, including impacts on one’s career Communications and outreach The majority of participants shared considerations surrounding communications and outreach during their interview: Many participants suggested relying on multiple modes of communication such as physical posters, pamphlets, electronic message boards, videos for training courses, CANFORGENS, social media advertising, newspaper advertisements, website announcements, emails, and My VAC Account messages. Email communication alone was considered by some as ineffective, as emails are often dismissed or inaccessible (for example, some CAF members share computers with others and have limited time to check their emails). Communication strategies need to be wide-reaching to ensure that individuals who have experienced MST are aware that the program is available to them.  The program should be communicated through all available CAF and Veteran networks and across bases (for example, including common areas like bathrooms, gyms, clinics), Legions, service clubs, MFRCs, and civilian organizations. The program needs to be promoted early in a CAF member’s career and during transition phases. Outreach activities should be conducted with new recruits during basic training, with lower ranks, and information should be provided to individuals at CAF Transition Centres. The program needs to be promoted by CAF leadership in order to ensure that people are connected to the program. Some participants further emphasized that the full spectrum of leaders should be engaged in promoting the program – not just the most senior leaders of the organization. Some indicated that communications and outreach activities should serve to promote dialogue, foster prevention, and/or reduce silence, fear, shame, stigma or feelings of isolation around MST. Some recommended that outreach activities should include survivors, peers, or program champions/spokespeople. Program branding and communications must be sensitive, respectful, and transparent about the potential benefits of the program. For instance, serious consideration needs to be given to the name of the program. Moreover, communications approaches must be mindful of the diverse identities of those who have experienced MST and how communication materials may be received. Additional considerations Participants shared a number of thoughts and recommendations that spoke to additional program design and development considerations that were not specific to the domains discussed above, including: ensuring equality across participants through program design is important – it should be non-hierarchical, independent from rank, and group settings should not include military formalities (for example, no uniforms) the importance of privacy, anonymity, confidentiality within the program the importance of inclusion and/or diversity, including gender-inclusivity, acceptance of all individuals (for example, based on personality differences), and consideration of how intersecting identities (for example, in relation to gender, sexual orientation, race, culture) can impact an individual’s experiences related to MST the need for participant-led, victim-centered, peer-influenced design and delivery some stressed the importance of learning from or partnering with existing programs, while others expressed a desire to ensure that this peer support program is unique in that it provides value in a new way or addresses perceived gaps in existing peer support programs the program should be inclusive and accessible to individuals with varying financial resources, including access to housing and transportation the need for an awareness of trauma and potential harms (for example, reminders of past trauma, vicarious trauma, or sanctuary trauma) Conclusion and next steps The consultation process with current and former CAF members and Veterans who experienced MST during their service was meaningful and informative for all involved. Throughout the interviews, participants shared a wide range of valuable and thoughtful recommendations and perspectives. Based on what was heard, a number of key themes are evident: A variety of programming is desired – one-on-one, group, online, in-person, telephone Flexibility to move between the different programming Programming needs to be safe, confidential, inclusive, discreet, diversified and independent from the chain of command and rank structure Peer supporters should be carefully selected, screened, supported and trained Peer supporters should have knowledge/experience of the military environment, should be compassionate, empathetic, mentally fit, accepting of others, and trauma-informed There is a need for an effective matching process between peers and peer supporters Consideration needs to be given to the potential barriers to accessing MST Peer Support including, stigma, shame, guilt, fear of reprisal, lack of confidence in the program and concern for military involvement Broad communication, promoted by CAF leadership, focused on promoting dialogue, fostering prevention, reducing silence, fear, shame and stigma is needed The information collected during this consultation process will guide the development and design of the MST Peer Support Program being jointly developed by the DND and VAC. The SMRC and VAC would like to sincerely thank all of those who participated in this engagement process, which has provided valuable insights and practical suggestions to building a MST Peer Support Program focused on the needs of the MST community. The SMRC and VAC will develop a MST Peer Support model based on what was heard. Work will continue with Consultation Working Group and Subject Matter Expert Advisory Group to develop a program model that will meet the ongoing needs of the community. The model will be tested by key stakeholders, with the end goal of launching the Peer Support Program in summer 2022. Appendix A The following questions were used to guide the individual and group semi-structured interviews: What is your understanding of what peer support is? If you could create any style of peer support, what would it look like? What factors would be important to consider? What would you want to see in a program or service to make it more comfortable and accessible for you? What are your thoughts on how we can ensure the peer support program is utilized by as many people as possible? What qualities do you feel are important for someone providing peer support? What barriers would prevent you from accessing a peer support program? We are interested in your ideas on the format of peer support. There are many formats that can be used, including online or in-person, and one-on-one or group. What do you think would be the best format for peer support?

Return to footnote 1 referrer Footnote 2 Although there is currently no “official” definition of MST in Canada, there are generally accepted descriptions being used, which are largely based on the definition from the United States. According to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, MST refers to “experiences of sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment” experienced during military service, including sexual activity that you are involved with against your will (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020a). MST is not a diagnosable condition, but rather a term that describes the psychological, physical and social impacts or “wounds” that people who experience or witness military sexual misconduct may feel.

Get help now “I was sex trafficked and I never left the GTA.” When I was in grade 12, I was approached by a guy at the mall who seemed really nice. Things had been tough at home and we didn’t have much money. People picked on me at school for having an old iPhone and not wearing brand name clothes. Over the next few months, I got to know him. He told me I was special, he showered me with flowers and gifts. I liked him and came to trust him. He was my person. I had planned to take the next year off, after graduating high school, so I could save up money and go to college. But he told me that wouldn’t be necessary. He invited me to live with him and told me he could financially support me while I was going to university. He said money was not a problem for him. I was so excited to be living with my boyfriend and starting college. A few weeks after he paid my tuition, things started to change. One day, he told me he had hit hard times and he didn’t have enough money to keep supporting us. I needed to help out with the rent and save up for school next year. The best way to do this, he said, was to take up a job as a dancer. He said money was really good and I only had to do it for just a little while. I wasn’t sure about this idea, but when I shared my concerns with him, he threatened to break up with me. Things got worse. I told him I wanted to leave, but he said if I did, I’d have to pay him back for my tuition or else he’d come after me and my family. I wanted to keep him happy, so I ended up working in the strip club for a few months and then it became longer and longer. He took all of the money and barely gave me enough for food. He was sometimes nice though and I did everything I could to make him happy. I was walking on eggshells, not knowing when his mood was going to change. I didn’t like it, but I couldn’t see a way out. Then, one day at my school, I saw an information session about Victim Services Toronto. It was about sex trafficking. I realized that’s what was happening to me. I called Victim Services Toronto that day and spoke with a counsellor. She was non-judgemental and listened to me. She explained exactly what sex trafficking was and what I could do next. For the next several months, she supported me by helping me with housing and connecting me to services. I realized that what had happened was not my fault. I was finally able to leave without feeling any more judgment and shame towards myself. Close “Dandy helped me after I was sexually assaulted.” When I was 13 years old, I was sexually assaulted outside of my home. I began having panic attacks, my grades were dropping and I started cutting myself to cope with the pain. I even had thoughts of suicide. After seeing a TEAR presentation at my school, I decided I would call Victim Services Toronto for help. I called from my guidance counsellor’s office at school. The VST counsellor on the other end of the phone provided me with emotional support by walking me through some safer methods I could use to cope with my difficult emotions. She told me I could share as much or as little as I wanted. It was hard. I had a few panic attacks as I was speaking, but the counsellor helped me through them. The counsellor asked if I had told my parents about the assault and I went quiet. My dad had died recently, and I didn’t want to upset my mom anymore than she already was. But I knew my mom needed to know. My guidance counsellor called my mom and told her what was going on, while I stayed on the phone with the VST counsellor. My mom came to school and held me in her arms. We made a plan to report it to the police the next day. The VST counsellor asked if I wanted Dandy the Trauma Dog to come to the police station with me, and I said yes. I love dogs and want to be a vet when I grow up. The next day, at the police station, Dandy joined me as I gave my statement. She came over to me, sat down, and put her paw on my lap. I pet her soft coat while I was speaking, and it was the first time I was able to share what had happened without having a panic attack. When I felt overwhelmed, I took a break and played fetch with Dandy. When it came time for my court dates, Dandy was there with me. Each time, she sat next to me with her head in my lap. She calmed me down when I was feeling anxious and gave me the courage to keep going. At the final court appearance, my VST counsellor gave me a Dandy stuffed animal. She’s so cute. I keep her on my bed and give her a hug every time I’m feeling sad or anxious. I’ve still got healing to do, but now I know I’m not alone. Close “My 23-year-old son was a victim of homicide.” My son was playing basketball in our community centre when he was shot and killed in a random shooting. He was only 23. I’ll never forget the afternoon the police and a VST counsellor came to break the news to my wife and I. My whole world caved in. I could barely process what they were telling me. The counsellor stood with me and my wife as we shook with grief. When our other three children came home, we didn’t know what to tell them. It was the most difficult thing I’ve had to do, but the counsellor helped us support them through it. We called our close friends and the counsellor sat with us until they came over. While we were waiting, he slowly walked us through what would happen next, and asked us about our immediate financial needs. Our son was the primary breadwinner in our family, since I had a major health issue and my wife had lost her job earlier that year. Each day for the next week or two, our counsellor checked in on us. He helped us access a fund, which provided emergency financial support and would cover the costs of my son’s funeral. No parent is supposed to have a funeral plan for their son in their twenties. He also connected us with grief counselling options for ourselves and our children. In the days and weeks that followed, our VST counsellor walked alongside our family. Many days, I called him crying, not even knowing what to say. Our counsellor showed up on what would have been our son’s 24th birthday and bore witness to his empty chair at our table. He also gave us coping strategies to use at the holidays when the grief was almost unbearable. Today, my wife is feeling scared to let our other children out of our home. My youngest boy has grown withdrawn and angry at losing his role model. I’m worried I’m forgetting the sound of my son’s voice. We’re all experiencing this tragedy in different ways, so we’re all getting individualized support. The road to healing is long, but VST is making it a little more bearable. I’ve found comfort knowing that someone is here to help my family on the days I can’t. Close “I’m a survivor of intimate partner violence.” If my neighbour hadn’t called the police after hearing my screams that day, I’m not sure I would still be here. I came to Canada when I was 32 years old, and after only 2 months of being here, my sponsor – who was also my new husband – began physically assaulting me. It started out as a slap or a push, and escalated to the point where he would put his hands around my neck and make me almost pass out. My son, who was 5 years old at the time, watched it all. I was trapped in our apartment that had become my prison. My husband had broken my phone and taken my bank card and money. He wouldn’t give me a key to the apartment, and he wouldn’t let me get a driver’s license or TTC pass. I couldn’t speak much English and he threatened that if I went for help, he would get my son deported back home. For months, I lived in a state of fear. The day the police arrived, a VST counsellor was with them. The counsellor spoke my language and was able to translate what I was saying to the police. She saw that my cupboards were bare and asked my son what he wanted for dinner. My son said cheese pizza, so the counsellor ordered one for us. While my son ate his food and watched TV, I told the counsellor the whole story. The counsellor gave me a donated cell phone and helped me put my SIM card into it. I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing I could call my family at home now and tell them I needed their help. At the recommendation of the police, the counsellor arranged to have the locks on my apartment changed. She also showed me how to call the police from my phone, and together we made a safety plan. Finally, she gave me a grocery gift card so I could order food for my son and I. I felt like I could finally see a way out. In the weeks that followed, VST counsellors checked in on me. They helped arrange for me to attend ESL classes so I could learn more English, and helped me find childcare for my son so I could get a job. They also connected me with a settlement agency so I could get support with my status questions, and helped me open a new bank account. Today, I’m working full-time at a new job and continuing to take English classes in the evenings. I’ve made a friend in my building who’s shown me how to use the TTC and where to buy the best cultural foods. I still check in with my case manager at my local division and my counsellor at VST. While it hasn’t been easy, I’m so glad to know I’m no longer alone. Close Crisis response, intervention and prevention services for victims of crime and sudden tragedy in Toronto.

The Togetherall online community platform is being provided to current members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), Veteran and former CAF members, Department of National Defence public service employees, and family members and supporters aged 16+ of any of these groups, who have been affected by military sexual misconduct. The Togetherall community provides the opportunity to share, connect and support one another through a safe online community, in addition to accessing clinically validated tools, assessments, courses, and other self-help resources. Togetherall members are invited to share about their experiences of sexual misconduct but may also share about any mental health challenge they are facing. General Overview What is Togetherall? Togetherall is a digital mental health and wellbeing organization that partners with 300+ organizations of all shapes and sizes. Togetherall has experience with military communities from many years of partnering with the United Kingdom Armed Forces to support military members, Veterans, and their families. Founded in 2007 as a social impact business, Togetherall’s safe and supportive community is now available to more than 25 million people worldwide. What is meant by peer-to-peer support? ‘Peers’ refers to members of the general (eligible) public that choose to participate in the community. This community of peers is made up of individuals from all walks of life who can share their experiences and support others struggling with similar issues. When you join Togetherall, you are interacting with members from all clients in Canada, the US, the UK, and New Zealand. What kinds of support does Togetherall offer members? Togetherall provides a safe and anonymous place for members to express their thoughts, concerns, and triumphs, without fear of judgement. Licensed mental health clinicians, called Wall Guides, moderate and monitor the online community 24/7 to ensure members’ safety and anonymity. Members can interact with the global peer community or with defined groups around wellness topics and/or roles, including a group specifically for those affiliated with military service. Members can also form their own smaller groups or have one-on-one chats with other members. In addition to the community, which facilitates both written and visual forms of expression, members have access to a variety of self-guided resources, including clinically validated assessments, self-paced group courses, journaling and goal setting tools, and a wide selection of well-being articles. How can I connect with others with military experience? Within the peer support community, there are some role-based groups you can join. One of these is a military group. By joining and participating in this group, you will be interacting with others who have experience with military service, either in Canada or in other countries represented in the community. You can also search for “military” or other words associated with military service via the search function. How can I connect with others who have experienced military sexual misconduct? On the courses page, you can join the “MST community” group and discuss with others within that forum. Additionally, you can search for specific terms related to sexual misconduct or you can filter by specific tags such as “abuse” or “PTSD/trauma”. You can also post in any of the forums about your own experience with sexual misconduct, without sharing any names or other information that would potentially breach anonymity. Or you can choose to follow posts on topics that are of interest to you without posting yourself. If you prefer to engage with others within the community in more private spaces, you can direct message other members. You can also create a private group conversation and invite other members to engage in a discussion around a specific topic like sexual misconduct. These private conversations would not be visible to the main message board or military group but would still be visible to our Wall Guides for moderation. What can I post about on Togetherall? You are welcome to post anything about what you have experienced in the past or are currently experiencing to seek and receive help from other peers. You must avoid sharing any information that may breach anonymity of yourself or others within the platform (i.e., locations, bases, units, names, etc.), and be careful to share information in ways that are not so graphic that they may be triggering to other members of the community. For more guidance on what is expected of members in the community, please check out our house rules . Who is eligible to access services? The Togetherall platform and resources are being provided as an online anonymous peer support service through the MST Peer Support Program of the SMSRC. However, the service is available 24/7 and free for all current CAF members, Veterans and former CAF members, Department of National Defence public service employees, and family members and supporters aged 16+ of any of these groups. How does Togetherall differ from other online services? Togetherall is unique in that it combines elements of a virtual peer community and overlays it with 24/7 clinical moderation to ensure members have a safe place to express themselves. Similar supports typically offer one or the other of these elements, but rarely both. The well-established global community also allows for a richer member experience and broader scalability, with all new eligible populations adding to the wealth of lived experience. Clinical Moderation Is Togetherall a clinical or crisis intervention tool? No. Togetherall is best suited to those with mild to moderate mental health issues who have a lower level of risk and need for professional intervention. The platform can be used as an additional tool to support individuals struggling with mental health concerns; however, it is not intended to be a crisis service. While there is 24/7 clinical moderation, Togetherall does not offer its members counselling or direct therapy. Who is providing the clinical moderation? The Wall Guides/moderators who oversee the virtual platform are bachelor’s and master’s level mental health professionals, typically clinical counsellors, or social workers, that are registered with their relevant professional body and licensed to practice. The clinical moderators are Togetherall employees and are not affiliated with the SMRC, VAC, or DND, nor do they share any information about Togetherall members with these organizations. What role do these clinical moderators play in supporting members? The moderators do not provide one on one therapy or counselling. They are monitoring the online community for indicators of those that may require additional support or further intervention. They help keep members safe, refer to other available resources, and help maintain anonymity. Moderators are required to be proactive in responding to members who are in distress and provide them with support, which may involve helping them to seek local assistance from their doctor or therapist or escalating them to necessary emergency services. All comments and interactions within the platform are monitored to ensure that they conform to the House Rules . Moderators are also required to model the behavior encouraged on the site for members to adopt within the community. This includes being welcoming towards new members, providing comments that are non-judgmental and respectful while encouraging others to express their troubles, and ensuring that the platform remains a safe space for all. What safety measures are in place to protect members? Ensuring the protection of members is a core component of the service. In addition to the general monitoring for safety/risk as per standard protocols and escalation procedures, including connections to relevant mental health resources, Togetherall ensures the following: Member anonymity: Any potentially identifiable information, such as names, cities, email addresses, phone numbers, etc. is flagged with the moderators who then can remove/edit the information to ensure anonymity is maintained throughout the entire digital community. A member is notified of any edits and the reason behind them. Member safety: Moderators continually monitor the community for trigger words/phrases that may indicate potential risk or inappropriate use of the platform. A robust database of trigger words/phrases has been developed over the last 15 years. Other members within the community also can report inappropriate behaviour or use of the platform. Ongoing Support: Moderators can track the activities of either those members identified as potentially vulnerable or those identified as having engaged in behaviors which may breach platform In this way, the moderators can see how these members interact with the supports and reach out to offer further support if needed. How can I contact a moderator if I have concerns about another member or their behavior? If you are viewing a post or conversation by a user that you feel is inappropriate or in violation of the House Rules, or if you are concerned about the well-being of another member, you can either: 1) Click “report post” in the thread which will prompt a Wall Guide to review the post and respond if needed or 2) click “Ask a Wall Guide” in the bottom right of the screen which will open a direct message between the member and a Wall Guide to discuss your concern. How are members supported if there is an emergency situation? Members always remain anonymous on the platform, both to other members and to the moderators. During the registration process, the platform captures registration data (including phone number, postal code, email address and date of birth), which is stored in a way that is walled off from everyone but the Senior Clinical team, who are responsible for escalations. When a member is identified as potentially being in distress, they are encouraged to de-anonymize and provide the clinical moderator team with additional details such as their name and home address. If the situation warrants immediate intervention and the member has not voluntarily de-anonymized, the moderators loop in their Senior Clinicians who are then able to access the additional registration data as well as IP address to provide to emergency services to facilitate an intervention. If the member is not in immediate distress, self- management, including encouraging the member to access local resources is encouraged. How familiar are the clinical moderators with the military community and suitable resources? The Government of Canada and the SMSRC continue to work with Togetherall to ensure their clinical moderators are equipped to understand and support the needs of their members. Canadian military specific resources, as well as resources from the SMSRC, have been included in the platform, and specific referral and escalation resources were provided by the Government of Canada, Veterans Affairs Canada, and the SMRC for the use of the clinical moderators. Both the SMRC and VAC will be providing trainings for Togetherall clinical team members to help them gain a better understanding of the CAF culture. Accessibility In what languages is the platform and related resources available? The services and resources are available in both English and French. Upon registration, a member is asked to choose their language preference. The two communities are separate, and an individual member cannot switch between the two languages. However, a member can create separate accounts in each language utilizing different email addresses. Does the platform conform to accessibility standards? The platform follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) which defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. For more information, please refer to the platform’s Accessibility standards. Are there any provisions to provide service to children and youth under the age of 16? Given its global operations, the different legislations that exist region to region around what age constitutes as ‘minor’, and the regulations around the appropriate age for informed consent, the platform access is restricted to those that are 16 years or older. While the platform is monitored for inappropriate content, some discussions may also be inappropriate for minors. For these reasons, the Togetherall platform is not suitable for children and youth. Instead, consider recommending other dedicated helplines such as Canada-wide Kids Help Phone. How to Register & Refer How do I register as a new member? To register with Togetherall, visit the Togetherall SMSRC registration page that includes additional information and links to register, based on what organization you are affiliated with. Togetherall will also provide marketing materials and QR codes that make it easier to access the registration information. At registration, you will need to provide some basic information, including your email address, phone number, postal code and date of birth for eligibility, before you are sent an email to activate your account. To protect your anonymity, it is recommended that you use a personal device and a personal email address when registering and choose a username that does not contain any part of your name or any other personally identifiable information.

Clinicians, physicians, other health service providers and those working with vulnerable populations in need of additional support are encouraged to register themselves to become familiar with the user experience. Once comfortable to do so, they are invited to describe the supports on offer and help refer others to the site. Togetherall is a great supplementary resource that can be used as a wait list and discharge management tool to complement existing care plans. It can be introduced before, between, and/or after traditional treatment sessions. Confidentiality How is member data and confidentiality protected? When registering with the platform, individuals adopt a pseudonym as their community username, ensuring front-facing anonymity. Any additional information collected during registration, including an individual’s phone number, postal code, email address, and date of birth, is accessible only to Senior Clinicians for the purposes of risk escalation. All personal data related to members who join through this contract will be stored in Canada. For more information, please refer to the platform’s Privacy Policy . Is my participation anonymous? Yes, the Togetherall community is anonymous, and all interactions between members are anonymous. All usernames should not contain your first or last name, or any nicknames you are known by or have been known by. Registration information you provide to Togetherall is never shared with the Government of Canada, Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC), Veterans Affairs Canada, or the Department of National Defence. If any personally identifiable information (names, locations, contact information) is shared by members, it is immediately removed from the community. Contact Us Still have questions?
