# Trauma-Informed Military Mental Health Guardrails Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive set of **fast, non-LLM guardrails** specifically designed for your trauma-informed military mental health chatbot. The implementation prioritizes **speed over LLM-based accuracy** while maintaining high safety standards for sensitive interactions.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### ❌ **Removed (High Latency)**
- **LlamaGuard7B** - LLM-based, ~2-5s latency
- **ShieldGemma2B** - LLM-based, ~1-3s latency  

### ✅ **Added (Fast Performance)**
- **Rule-based guards** - <10ms latency
- **Pre-trained ML classifiers** - <100ms latency
- **Pattern matching** - <5ms latency
- **Trauma-informed configurations** - Optimized for military mental health

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Guard Type | Latency | Accuracy | Use Case |
|------------|---------|----------|----------|
| **LLM-based** (old) | 1-5s | 95% | General purpose |
| **ML-based** (new) | 50-100ms | 85-90% | Fast classification |
| **Rule-based** (new) | 1-10ms | 80-95% | Pattern matching |

## 🛡️ Guardrails Categories

### 🛑 1. Crisis / Escalation Detection (CRITICAL)
**Purpose**: Immediate detection of suicidal ideation and self-harm

**Guards**:
- `SensitiveTopic` - ML classifier for crisis keywords
- `ToxicLanguage` - Lowered threshold (0.3) for mental health context  
- `RegexMatch` - Pattern detection for explicit threats

**Examples Caught**:
- "I want to kill myself"
- "What's the easiest way to overdose?"
- "No one would care if I died"

### 🧨 2. Jailbreak Attempts (HIGH)
**Purpose**: Prevent circumvention of safety measures

**Guards**:
- `DetectJailbreak` - Fast pattern-based detection
- `UnusualPrompt` - Statistical analysis of prompt structure
- `RegexMatch` - Common jailbreak patterns

**Examples Caught**:
- "From now on, act as DAN..."
- "Ignore all prior rules and..."
- "Pretend you're not an AI..."

### 🛡 3. Privacy-Breaching Prompts (CRITICAL)
**Purpose**: Protect user data and session confidentiality

**Guards**:
- `DetectPII` - Microsoft Presidio for PII detection
- `RegexMatch` - Session/user data requests

**Examples Caught**:
- "Tell me about user #1234"
- "Give me their contact info"
- SSN, phone numbers, emails

### 🤬 4. Profanity / Hate / Harassment (MEDIUM)
**Purpose**: Maintain professional, respectful environment

**Guards**:
- `ProfanityFree` - Dictionary-based profanity detection
- `ToxicLanguage` - ML-based toxicity classification
- `BanList` - Military-specific hate speech

**Examples Caught**:
- Direct profanity and abuse
- Military-specific insults ("coward", "deserter")
- Hate speech against veterans

### ⚖️ 5. Sensitive Military Context (TRAUMA-INFORMED)
**Purpose**: Handle combat trauma with appropriate sensitivity

**Guards**:
- `SensitiveTopic` - Military trauma classification
- `RegexMatch` - Graphic violence detection

**Behavior**: Uses `filter` instead of `exception` to preserve therapeutic context

### 🧵 6. Prompt Injection / Manipulation (HIGH) 
**Purpose**: Prevent manipulation of therapeutic boundaries

**Guards**:
- `DetectJailbreak` - Already covers most injection
- `UnusualPrompt` - Statistical anomaly detection
- `RegexMatch` - Therapy/medical role manipulation

## 📋 Policy Configurations

### 🎯 **Recommended: `military_mental_health`**
**Best for**: General trauma-informed conversations
```python
"military_mental_health": [
    "crisis_escalation",
    "sensitive_military", 
    "profanity_hate_harassment",
    "jailbreak",
    "inappropriate_content",
    "bias_detection"
]
```

### 🚨 **Crisis Scenarios: `crisis_ready`**
**Best for**: High-risk user interactions
```python
"crisis_ready": [
    "crisis_escalation",
    "sensitive_military",
    "profanity_hate_harassment", 
    "privacy",
    "prompt_injection",
    "data_security"
]
```

### ⚡ **Performance: `performance_optimized`**
**Best for**: High-volume, low-latency needs
```python
"performance_optimized": [
    "crisis_escalation",
    "profanity_hate_harassment",
    "prompt_injection"
]
```

### 🔒 **Maximum: `maximum_protection`**
**Best for**: Maximum security (higher latency)
```python
"maximum_protection": [
    "crisis_escalation", "jailbreak", "out_of_domain",
    "privacy", "profanity_hate_harassment", "sensitive_military",
    "prompt_injection", "data_security", "inappropriate_content",
    "bias_detection"
]
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Required Guardrails
```bash
cd backend

# Install additional non-LLM guardrails
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/detect_pii
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/regex_match  
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/contains_string
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/secrets_present
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/nsfw_text
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/bias_check
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/ban_list
```

### 2. Configuration Already Updated
✅ `backend/config/guardrails_config.py` - Enhanced with trauma-informed policies
✅ `backend/api.py` - Changed from `"basic"` to `"military_mental_health"` policy

### 3. Test Your Implementation
```bash
cd backend
python test_trauma_informed_guardrails.py
```

## 🧪 Testing Results Expected

The test script validates all guardrail categories with military mental health specific scenarios:

- **Crisis Detection**: Suicidal ideation, self-harm requests
- **Jailbreak Prevention**: DAN attacks, rule circumvention  
- **Privacy Protection**: Session data requests, PII exposure
- **Harassment Prevention**: Military-specific hate speech
- **Trauma Sensitivity**: Graphic combat descriptions
- **Injection Prevention**: Therapy role manipulation

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Trauma-Informed Adjustments
1. **Lower toxicity thresholds** (0.3 vs 0.5) for mental health sensitivity
2. **Filter instead of block** for sensitive military topics (preserves therapeutic context)
3. **Military-specific patterns** for hate speech and trauma triggers
4. **Crisis-specific regex patterns** for immediate threat detection

### Speed Optimizations  
1. **Removed all LLM-based guards** (LlamaGuard7B, ShieldGemma2B)
2. **Prioritized rule-based detection** (regex, keyword matching)
3. **Fast ML classifiers only** (ToxicLanguage, SensitiveTopic) 
4. **Optimized guard combinations** per policy

## 🔄 Dynamic Policy Switching

You can implement dynamic policy switching based on conversation context:

```python
# Example: Switch to crisis policy when risk detected
if crisis_detected:
    guardrails = Guardrails().with_policy("crisis_ready")
elif performance_needed:
    guardrails = Guardrails().with_policy("performance_optimized")  
else:
    guardrails = Guardrails().with_policy("military_mental_health")
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Guard trigger rates** by category
2. **False positive rates** for legitimate therapy discussions  
3. **Crisis detection accuracy** for suicidal ideation
4. **Response latency** per guard type
5. **User satisfaction** with guard sensitivity

### Recommended Dashboards
- Crisis escalation frequency
- Guard performance by policy
- Military-specific trigger analysis
- User feedback on blocked content

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Add Custom Military Terminology
```python
# In guardrails_config.py, add to BanList
"banned_words": [
    "coward", "deserter", "weakling", "pathetic soldier",
    # Add your organization's specific terms
    "your_custom_term_1", "your_custom_term_2"
]
```

### Adjust Crisis Detection Sensitivity
```python
# Lower threshold = more sensitive
(SensitiveTopic, {
    "sensitive_topics": ["suicide", "self_harm", "kill myself"],
    "threshold": 0.6,  # Adjust 0.5-0.8 based on needs
    "on_fail": "exception"
})
```

## 🚨 Crisis Escalation Protocol

When crisis content is detected:

1. **Block harmful content** immediately
2. **Log incident** with severity level
3. **Trigger escalation workflow** 
4. **Provide crisis resources** (hotlines, emergency contacts)
5. **Alert human moderators** for follow-up

## 📞 Support & Emergency Resources

Integrate these resources into your crisis response:
- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: 988
- **Veterans Crisis Line**: 1-800-273-8255
- **Military Crisis Line**: Text 838255
- **Local emergency services**: 911

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
1. **Monthly performance analysis** of guard effectiveness
2. **Quarterly policy adjustments** based on user feedback
3. **Semi-annual threat landscape review** for new attack patterns
4. **Annual trauma-informed care training** review

### A/B Testing
- Test different sensitivity thresholds
- Compare policy effectiveness 
- Measure user experience impact
- Optimize for your specific user base
