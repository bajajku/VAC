The program provides supportive and facilitated restorative opportunities for Canadian Armed Forces and National Defence Sexual Misconduct Class Action Members to be heard and acknowledged, and for Defence Representatives to learn, understand, plan, act, and lead as catalysts for change.\n\n**Program Development and Implementation**\n\nThe RE Program was developed by a dedicated team within the Sexual Misconduct Support and Resource Centre (SMSRC) in collaboration with subject matter experts and stakeholders, including individuals who experienced sexual misconduct in the Defence workplace. The program was launched in its initial operating capability (IOC) on November 15, 2021.\n\n**Program Team**\n\nThe RE Program team consists of:\n\n* Director of RE\n* Deputy Director\n* Managers of Operations\n* Restorative practitioners\n\n**Restorative Approach**\n\nThe RE Program applies a restorative approach to help CAF/DND contribute to culture change.

Class members meet with restorative practitioners to learn about the program and determine if it can meet their objectives.\n2. Class members identify their objectives for the engagement process and decide what experiences, knowledge, and/or insights they want to share.\n3. Class members reflect on and discuss their experience in the program and share their feedback.\n\n**Defence Representatives**\n\nDefence representatives are CAF members and DND public service employees who participate in the program to learn from the experiences and insights of class members and to contribute to culture change. They commit to listening with an open mind, participating actively in reflective learning activities, and carrying what they learn forward into their career.\n\n**Restorative Practitioners**\n\nRestorative practitioners are DND public service employees who facilitate restorative processes and principles, assisting class members and Defence representatives in participating in the program. They are independent from the CAF chain of command.\n\n**Support Services and Resources**\n\nParticipating in the program can be rewarding, but it can also bring up difficult emotions.

    "page_content": "About the Peer Support Program\n================================\n\n### Definition\n\nPeer support is the giving and receiving of emotional support among people who share a common experience. It offers a safer space where peers affected are believed and their experiences validated. It also promotes a sense of:\n\n* Belonging\n* Encouragement\n* Solidarity\n* Healing\n* Empowerment\n* Resilience\n\n### Creating a Peer Support Program\n\nPeople affected by sexual misconduct and military sexual trauma (MST) report that the specific DND/CAF aspects of their experiences are not always well understood by external civilian practitioners or service providers. They often describe feelings of isolation when seeking support services. Many people who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or MST through their service or in their place of work and those who work to support them, have requested the development of a Peer Support Program.\n\nThis program supports CAF members, former CAF members/Veterans, current and former DND public service employees, Cadets, Junior Canadian Rangers, 18 years and older who have experienced sexual misconduct and/or military sexual trauma during their service or in their workplace. The objectives of the program are to:\n\n* Bring people together with shared experiences\n* Support safer environments to give and receive peer support\n* Help create meaningful connections and share in learning\n* Reduce isolation and stigma\n* Increase participant’s sense of empowerment\n* Contribute to overall wellbeing\n\n### The Peer Support Program\n\nThe Peer Support Program is being launched in a phased approach. Consultations with people affected were held in the fall of 2021 to better understand their needs and wants. The program needed to offer a diverse array of peer support services. Subject matter experts with experience in trauma care, military sexual trauma, sexual misconduct, mental health, peer support, and more were also consulted.\n\nProgram evaluations, such as anonymous online surveys and one-to-one discussions with program staff, are in place to assess the service. Evaluation results are used to inform future developments of the program. Community consultations are also hosted to further collect feedback.\n\n### Meet the Peer Support Team\n\n* **Peer Supporters**: Peers with lived experience of sexual misconduct and/or MST who are trained to support others through the delivery of our Peer Support Program services.\n* **Mental Health Professionals**: Social Workers or Social Service Workers who specialize in peer support, mental health, trauma care, and helping people affected by sexual misconduct and MST.\n* **Peer Support Regional Coordinators**: Members of the peer support team who conduct intakes with peer participants, coordinate peer support services, and act as a main point of contact for the program.\n\n### Training for Peer Supporters\n\nAll peer supporters and mental health professionals take part in the SMSRC orientation training, which includes:\n\n* Fundamentals of peer support\n* Active listening\n* Trauma-informed approach to care\n* What is gender-based violence\n* Intersecting forms of oppression and harm\n* Impacts of trauma\n* Crisis management\n* Self-care\n* Leading group discussions\n\n### Get Involved\n\nIf you are a CAF member, former CAF member/Veteran, current or former DND public service employee, Cadet, Junior Canadian Ranger affected by sexual misconduct and/or MST, 18 years and older, and are interested in trying out the Peer Support Program services, please send an email to: SMSRCPSP-CSRISPSP@forces.gc.ca.",

While the engagement process began with 55 participants who initially volunteered, 26 were not in a place to participate due to their trauma or timing.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\n1. **Co-facilitation**: Views on the need for co-facilitators for group sessions were divided. Some indicated a need for mental health professionals to assist, and others indicated preferring no professional support.\n2. **Communication**: Many were not aware of available resources after their traumatic event and hope to prevent this from happening to others.\n3. **Screening process**: Safe and inclusive intake process with thorough peer supporter screening. Flexibility was viewed as essential, and participants want the choice to engage in a process that best meets their needs.\n4. **Program delivery**: Choice of format. Interest in various formats included in-person and virtual engagements for one-to-one meetings and small group sessions.\n5. **Safety**: Confidential, discreet, and independent from the chain of command and the CAF rank structure. Importance of safety from further institutional harm and perpetrators that inflicted trauma was emphasized.\n6. **Training and experience**: Peer supporters training in mental health, trauma, boundaries, and ethics.

By bringing relevant, robust capabilities to NATO's northern and western flanks, Canada will make valuable contributions to our partnerships in Europe and the Indo-Pacific in defence of our shared security and prosperity.\n\nOur North, Strong and Free sets out a renewed vision for the future of defence in Canada, focusing on building a Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) that continues to keep us strong at home, secure in North America, and engaged in the world. Canadian security and prosperity in the coming years will be affected by three key trends: a more open and accessible Arctic and northern region driven by climate change, increasing global instability, and rapid advances in technology.\n\nOur renewed vision is focused on preparing the military to meet these accelerating challenges, prioritizing those that most directly impact Canadians and Canada. It reaffirms that our insurance against instability and geopolitical uncertainty is a ready, resilient and relevant CAF capable of defending Canada at home, ensuring security in North America, and contributing to an international order that is free and open, inclusive, stable, and governed by the rule of law.\n\nCanada is committed to building a stronger military that is equipped to deliver increased security for Canadians. Our investments will enable the military to adapt in a sustainable, responsible manner, guided by our evolving national security needs in a more dangerous world. The CAF’s mission is to defend Canada and advance the safety, security, and prosperity of Canadians when and wherever it is needed.\n\nFurther investments in our military will enable the CAF to respond to a rapidly changing climate and its impact on Canada's Arctic, brazen challenges to global stability, and accelerating technological innovation. The objectives and initiatives laid out in Our North, Strong and Free will help Canada meet the pivotal moment of changing and increasing threats and help maintain the security and prosperity that Canadians have long enjoyed, through a robust, world-class military and defence team that reflects the full diversity and talent that Canada has to offer.",

    "page_content": "The SMSRC’s Restorative Engagement Program Updates Fall 2023\n\nDear class member,\n\nThis message is being sent to you as someone who expressed interest in receiving information regarding the Restorative Engagement (RE) Program on their claim form for the CAF-DND Sexual Misconduct Class Action Settlement. The following will provide you with a few updates on the activities occurring within the RE program.\n\nProgress in the Program\nSince the launch of the program two years ago, we have had meaningful and restorative conversations. Class members' feedback on how to improve the program has been crucial. Many said that the wait time to be contacted was too long. We acknowledge that and to allow us to contact a greater number of class members, we recently hired intake officers across the country. To date, we have contacted more than 1,500 class members who have submitted their claim and shown an interest in RE.\n\nBefore the end of the calendar year, intake officers will be connecting with you to confirm your interest in the program. We encourage you to monitor your inbox or mailbox and reply to our message as soon as you can so that we can ensure your participation is expedited.\n\nDefence representatives' contribution is key to the success of the program to provide class members the opportunity to engage with them directly or indirectly. To date, 11 cohorts, which are small groups of up to eight Defence representatives, have completed their participation in the RE program. We are currently facilitating three cohorts and are planning another five in January 2024. These representatives are Defence Team members who volunteered to acknowledge and learn from your experiences and insights and contribute to culture change in a meaningful and tangible way.\n\nDid You Know?\nDefence representatives participate in the program in small groups called cohorts. Restorative practitioners are assigned to facilitate their participation. The three phases of the cohort process are:\n\n1. Phase 1: Learning and Connecting\n   - Defence representatives build knowledge on the issue of sexual misconduct, the culture that contributes to it, and restorative approaches.\n   - Develop skills to support their roles in the program and prepare to engage with class members.\n   - Consider their role and responsibility in addressing the problem of sexual misconduct.\n\n2. Phase 2: Listening, Learning and Understanding\n   - Defence representatives continue to learn about the contexts, causes, and impacts of sexual misconduct, and what needs to change to end it (including learning through engagement sessions with class members).\n   - Develop restorative leadership skills by facilitating parts of the cohort.\n   - Begin developing leadership plans for how they will take the knowledge and skills they have gained back to their roles in the institution.\n\n3. Phase 3: Preparing, Planning and Acting\n   - Defence representatives deepen their understanding of what needs to change at the individual, collective, and institutional levels to end sexual misconduct.\n   - Plan and prepare strategies and actions to contribute to culture change as they return to their regular duties.\n   - Choose an issue/idea and will learn more about it, so that they can apply what they learn to act in support of change.\n\nInformation Sessions\nWe are offering new live information sessions for those who want to know more about the RE program and what to expect when participating. No registration needed; just click and join on the day of the session.\n\n- Wednesday, December 13, 2023, 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. (English)\n- Thursday, December 14, 2023, 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. (French)\n- Tuesday, December 19, 2023, 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. (English)\n- Wednesday, December 20, 2023, 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. (French)\n\nHow to Reach Out\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please reach out at RE-DR@forces.gc.ca or by phone at 1-833-998-2048. We will continue to provide you with updates throughout the program. You can also reach out to the SMSRC 24/7 line at 1-844-750-1648. Counsellors can provide you with confidential support, including information on options, guidance on supporting others, and referrals to care and service organizations. This service is available in either official language.\n\nNote: We are unable to provide you with an update on your claim and invite you to contact the Claims Administrator about the CAF-DND Sexual Misconduct Class Action Settlement at info@caf-dndsexualmisconductclassaction.ca or by telephone at 1-888-626-2611. Please inform us and the Claims Administrator of any changes to your contact information (for example, your email address or phone number), by emailing us at RE-DR@forces.gc.ca or by phone at 1-833-998-2048.\n\nThank you again for your patience as we continue to work with the class member community to deliver a meaningful restorative experience. You can expect to be contacted before the end of the year.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Restorative Engagement program team",
